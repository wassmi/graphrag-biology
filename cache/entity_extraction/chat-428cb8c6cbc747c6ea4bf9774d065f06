By\ncontrast, on TCR engagement, the proportion of pSTAT4-\npositive cells was higher in CD8 T cells carrying the CD226\nrisk allele compared with CD8 T cells with the protective one(Figure 5A). Restimulating the cells for 15 minutes in the\npresence of IL-12 further increased the phosphorylation of\nSTAT4 (Figure 5B). We obtained a similar result on stimu-lation in the presence of IFN αfor 15 minutes, suggesting that\nthis observation is not speci ﬁc to IL-12, rather related to\nSTAT4 itself (Figure 5C).\nWe next tested whether these alterations of the IFN γpathway\nwere still observed on CD8 T-cell activation under Tc1 po-larization conditions. Thus, we activated total CD8 T cells\nwith anti-CD3 mAb and IL-12 for 3 or 5 days. The expression\nof CD69 was similar between the 2 groups indicating com-parable activation (Figure 6A, eFigure 6A). Compared with\nstimulation with CD3 alone, the addition of IL-12 signi ﬁ-\ncantly increased the frequency of CD226+ (Figure 6B) and T-BET+ (Figure 6C) only in the CD8 T cells carrying the risk\nallele. The level of expression of CD226 (eFigure 6B) and\nT-BET (eFigure 6C) was similar between both genotypes.Secretion of IFN γwas drastically increased on IL-12 sup-\nplementation, and this was again higher in the supernatant of\nCD8 T cells expressing the risk allele (Figure 6D). After ad-dition of IL-12, we found that the IL-12R β2 chain, known to\nbe regulated by STAT4, was upregulated with a strong dif-\nference between the 2 CD226 alleles especially after 5 days ofactivation (Figure 7A, eFigure 6D). By contrast, in this ex-\nperimental setting, the IL-12R β1 was slightly sensitive to IL-\n12 (Figure 7B, eFigure 6E). Of interest, after IL-12 addition,\nall cells that expressed the IL-12R β2 on the addition of IL-12\nwere CD226+ (Figure 7C), suggesting that CD226 is directly\ninvolved in the IL-12R β2/STAT4/IFN γpathway and that\nthis pathway is ampli ﬁed in donors expressing the CD226 risk\nvariant (Figure 7D).\nDiscussion\nMounting appropriate T cell –driven immune responses re-\nquires the integration of a multitude of signals that arise from\nvarious types of receptors. The TCR signaling pathways in-\nduced after antigen stimulation are ﬁne-tuned by cos-\ntimulatory molecules to adjust the sensitivity of T cells\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
