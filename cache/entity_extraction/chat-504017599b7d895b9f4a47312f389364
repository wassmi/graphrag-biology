We did not detect any signi ﬁcant\nDEGs in the ex vivo unstimulated T cells and on 4 hours ofactivation. By contrast, we detected 44 upregulated genes in\nthe risk allele and 96 in the protective allele after 24 hours of\nactivation (Figure 2A). Of interest, among the di ﬀerentially\noverexpressed genes with the risk allele (Figure 2, A and B),\nwe found IFN γand Granzyme H, 2 key molecules for CD8\nT-cell functions. Of note, the nuclear orphan receptor sub-family 4 group A member 3 (NR4A3), triggered by TCR\nsignaling and related to CD8 T-cell di ﬀerentiation and ef-\nfector function,\n22was also upregulated with the risk allele.\nOther interesting upregulated genes related to T-cell signaling\nwere oncostatin M (OSM), sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1),\nand Fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1). OSMencodes a cytokine and growth regulator that is part of the\ncytokine production signaling regulated by ERK and AKT\n23\nwhile SPHK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to\nform sphingosine 1-phosphate that promotes the activation of\nNF-kappa-B and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase\n(MAPK) signaling.24FLT1 encodes a tyrosine-protein kinase\nthat is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor\nreceptor family, leading to the activation of phospholipase Cgamma, MAPK, and AKT signaling pathways.\n25\nTo better understand the overall impact of the CD226-Gly307Ser variant on CD8 T-cell transcriptome after 24 hours\nof stimulation, we performed gene ontology (Figure 2C) and\nKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichmentanalyses (Figure 2D). Results revealed increased expression of\ngenes involved in regulation of protein kinase activity, JAK-\nSTAT and PI3K-AKT signaling, calcium signaling pathway,cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and cellular senescence.\nTo explore whether certain signaling pathways began to be\nderegulated after 4 hours of stimulation, we performed the geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) that uses a di ﬀerent and\ncomplementary methodology to di ﬀerential expression analysis\n(eFigure 2). Of note, it con ﬁrmed the enrichment of genes\ninvolved in T-cell receptor (eFigure 2A) and JAK-STAT sig-\nnaling pathways (eFigure 2B) already detected at 24 hours.\nMoreover, we also found an enrichment of genes involved in“positive regulation of IFN γproduction ”in the CD8 T cells\nfrom donors carrying the risk allele compared with those car-\nrying the protective allele (eFigure 2C). These results suggestthat on CD3 and CD28 stimulation, CD8 T cells carrying the\nrisk allele are transcriptionally more prone to support TCR\nsignaling, JAK-STAT pathways, and IFN γproduction.Risk Allele of CD226 Selectively Increases the\nPhosphorylation of ERK1/2 in CD8 T CellsIn murine thymocytes, the deletion of CD226 a ﬀects the\nTCR-induced activation of AKT, ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1),\nNF-KB, and P38 (MAPK14) signaling\n26suggesting that\nCD226 ﬁne-tunes TCR signaling. Thus, we compared the\nTCR signaling of expanded human CD8 T cells carrying the\nCD226 protective or risk variant after the engagement ofthe TCR. We showed that the CD226 risk allele led to a\nselective increase in the phosphorylation of the MAPKs\nextracellular signal –regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)\nafter TCR stimulation of CD8 T cells (Figure 3, A and B). In\ncomparison, the CD226 risk allele did not a ﬀect signi ﬁ-\ncantly the extent of AKT (Figure 3, A and C) and MAPKp38 (Figure 3, A and D) phosphorylation indicative of its\nspeciﬁceﬀect on TCR signaling pathways. Because ERK is\none of the main signaling molecules involved in di ﬀerent\nT-cell programs, such as act ivation, proliferation, di ﬀeren-\ntiation, and cytokine production, we next sought to in-\nvestigate whether the impact of the Gly307Ser variant ofCD226 on ERK activation could be associated with changes\nin CD8 T-cell functions.\nCD226 Risk Allele Confers Elevated IFN γ\nProduction by CD8 T Cells\nTo analyze the impact of the CD226 Gly307Ser variant on\nCD8 T-cell functions, we isolated CD8 T cells and stimulatedthem for 3 days with plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb alone or in\ncombination with anti-CD28 mAb. The cells were then ana-\nlyzed for proliferation, viability, activation markers, andtranscription factor expression by ﬂow cytometry. In addition,\nthe cytokine production in culture supernatants collected af-\nter 3 days of stimulation was determined by CBA.\nWe did not ﬁnd any signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences in CD8 T-cell\nviability and proliferation between the 2 genotypes(eFigure 3A).
