In conclusion, all of them were moderate or weak rec -\nommendations. The details can be found in Supplementary Table 2 .\nDiscussion\nAA is characterized by systemic dysregulation of Th1 (TNF-α, IL-12 \nand IFN-γ), Th2, and Th17 (TGF-β1) cytokines [ 26]. Studies have \nshown that patients with AA with a SALT score of ≥ 25% have \nhigher serum TNF-α levels than those with a SALT score of < 25%, \nand the serum TNF-α levels are positively correlated with the \nseverity of AA [ 27, 28]. Compared with healthy control individuals, \npatients with AA have greater expression of IL-12 mRNA in peripheral blood monocytes, and serum IL-12 levels are positively \ncorrelated with the severity and duration of hair loss [ 29, 30]. \nIFN-γ- induced immune collapse of hair follicles can cause the \noccurrence of AA [ 31]. A study showed an increased serum levels \nof IFN-γ in patients with active AA in comparison with patients \nwith stable AA [ 32]. TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that can reg -\nulate the growth cycle of hair follicles and the degradation period \nof hair growth and also activate hair follicle stem cells to stimulate \nhair growth [ 33]. The serum levels of TGF-β1 in patients with AA \nare lower than those in healthy people, especially in patients with \nactive AA [ 27, 34].\nCG is derived from the traditional Chinese medicine licorice, and as \na complementary and alternative TCM treatment method, it has been \nwidely used to treat various skin diseases closely related to autoim -\nmune reactions [ 35]. CG can inhibit the activity of CD4+ cells, CD8+ \ncells and related cytokines and enhance the differentiation of extrathy -\nmic T cells. Thus, it inhibits the progression of AA and promotes hair \nregeneration [ 36]. Our study found that adding CG to topical minoxidil \ncan reduce the levels of multiple Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-12 and \nIFN-γ). Meanwhile, several studies have shown that CG can increase \nthe levels of IL-10 in patients with AA [ 16, 37]. And IL-10 is mainly \nproduced by Th2 cells, which can inhibit the production of \npro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit the immune response of Th1 \ntype cells. These indicated that CG may treat AA by regulating the bal -\nance of Th1/Th2 cells.\nTopical minoxidil can promote the proliferation and differentiation \nof hair follicle epithelial cells, improve the microvascular circulation \naround hair follicles, and activate potassium channels on peripheral \narterial smooth muscles, inducing cell proliferation. Moreover, it can \nalso increase vascular endothelial growth factor in dermal cells in a \ndose-dependent manner, stimulate the production of prostaglandin \nE2, and thus prolong the anagen phase [ 38]. The combination of oral \nCG and topical minoxidil is suggested to compensate for the short -\ncomings of topical application in overall immune regulation, \nanti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects, balances helper T-cell func -\ntion, suppresses autoimmune reactions, reduces local inflammatory \nreactions in AA, and improves clinical efficacy.\nMany research have shown that the evaluation of trichoscopic \ncan help diagnose AA and predict the course of the disease. For \nexample, black dots, broken hairs, and exclamation mark hairs may \nbe related to the activity of AA, while yellow dots may be posi -\ntively correlated with the severity of AA. Short vellus hairs are \nadversely correlated with the severity or activity of the AA [ 39, 40]. \nNotably, one study we included reported the trichoscopic findings, \nwhich revealed that after 12 weeks and 6 months of combined \ntreatment with CG and topical minoxidil, the number of black \ndots, broken hairs, exclamation mark hairs, and empty follicular \nopenings in AA area significantly decreased, while the number of \nshort vellus hairs increased [ 16]. Also, it indicated that this combi -\nnation therapy can improve hair and hair follicle density, as well as \nreduced recurrence rates.\nIn this study, we analyzed\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
