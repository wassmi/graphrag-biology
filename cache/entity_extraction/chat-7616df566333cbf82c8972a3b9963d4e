Red color indicates the C- terminus of PSMA4 where BirA* is fused (not present in the structure), \nand the identified biotinylated lysines are depicted in orange. Only the structure of the modified subunit is depicted with a surface model and all the \nother subunits are depicted as helix- loop structures. Biotinylated residues were obtained from the ACN fraction of PSMA4- BirA*. The proteasome \nstructure depicted was obtained from the PDB:5T0C model of the human 26Â S proteasome (Chen etÂ al., 2016) and rendered using Chimera (Pettersen \netÂ al., 2004).

Equal amounts of protein extracts were incubated with proteasome substrate LLVY- 7- Amino- 4- methylcoumarin \n(AMC) and substrate cleavage assessed by fluorimetry. n=3 biological replicates, error bars indicate standard deviation of the mean, paired t- test. \nFigure 2 continued on next page\n\n Tools and resources      \nBiochemistry and Chemical Biology\nBartolome etÂ al. eLife 2024;13:RP93256. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.93256  7 of 32approaches: Fabre etÂ al., 2015 used fractionation by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation, Bousquet- \nDubouch etÂ al., 2009 used immunoaffinity purification, and (Geladaki etÂ al., 2019) applied cellular \nfractionation by differential centrifugation. We found 72 proteins overlapping to our dataset including \nalmost all known proteasome members, assembly factors, and activators (FigureÂ  3e and f). The \noverlapping proteins also include members of other complexes known to interact with the protea-\nsome, that is the SKP1- CUL1- F- box protein (SCF) complex (CUL1 and FBOX7), and the chaperonin \ncontaining TCP- 1 (CCT) complex (CCT2, CCT3, CCT5 and CCT7). Some proteins common to at \nleast two of previous studies but were missing in our dataset include immunoproteasome subunits \n(PSMB10/LMP10, PSMB8/LMP7) that are not expressed in HEK293 cells, the shuttling factor RAD23B \nand ubiquitin- related proteins including USP14, UCHL5 and UBE3C. Manual inspection of proteins \nidentified exclusively by ProteasomeID revealed additional 37 proteins that were reported in addi-\ntional studies that investigated proteasome interactions (summarized in Supplementary file 3), and \n19 proteins that have been associated to the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS; FigureÂ 2âfigure \nsupplement 1f). In addition, another 176 proteins found in the ProteasomeID network are interactors \nof previously reported proteasome interacting proteins, according to high confidence interactions \nfrom the STRING database (Snel etÂ al., 2000; FigureÂ 3g). Therefore, in total, 304 out of 608 (50%) \nProteasomeID enriched proteins could be matched to known proteasome- interacting proteins or their \ndirect binding partners. The remaining 304 proteins, which are enriched in GO terms related to micro-\ntubule and cilia organization (Supplementary file 3), likely represent novel interacting proteins, or \nfalse positives due to the presence of a subpopulation of unassembled PSMA4- BirA*. Comparing \nthe enrichment scores, however, suggest that they are likely proteins that come into proximity of the \nproteasome without physically interacting with it (FigureÂ 2âfigure supplement 1g).\nIdentification of proteasome substrates by ProteasomeID\nHaving demonstrated that ProteasomeID can be used to obtain snapshots of the proteasome- \nproximal proteome, we next investigated whether we could use this approach to identify proteasome \nsubstrates. We reasoned that under steady state conditions the interaction between proteasomes \nand their substrates might be too short lived to enable efficient biotinylation. Furthermore, the \nproteolytic cleavage of substrates by the proteasome would eventually make biotinylated peptides \nimpossible to be identified by our standard proteomic workflow based on tryptic peptides. There-\nfore, we generated HEK293T cell lines expressing PSMA4- miniTurbo or miniTurbo alone, enabling \nshorter biotinylation time thanks to the enhanced activity of miniTurbo as compared to BirA* (Branon \netÂ al., 2018; FigureÂ 4âfigure supplement 1a and b). We tested biotinylation by PS\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
