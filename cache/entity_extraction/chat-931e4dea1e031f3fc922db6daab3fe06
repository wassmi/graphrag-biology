In addition,\nthe cytokine production in culture supernatants collected af-\nter 3 days of stimulation was determined by CBA.\nWe did not ﬁnd any signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences in CD8 T-cell\nviability and proliferation between the 2 genotypes(eFigure 3A). The frequency of CD226-positive CD8 T cells\nincreased on activation with a higher trend in the CD8\nT cells from the risk group while the MFI was similarlyaugmented (eFigure 3B). CD8 T cells from both groups\nexpressed similar frequencies and MFI of the activation\nmarkers CD69 and PD1 indicative of comparable activationlevels (eFigure 3, C and D). In addition, the expression of\nthe receptor TIGIT was not di ﬀerent between the 2 groups\n(eFigure 3E). Among all cytokines tested, only IFN γwas\nsigniﬁcantly increased in the supernatant of CD8 T cells\nexpressing the risk allele (Figure 4A). By contrast, the pro-\nduction of TNF, IL-17, IL-10, perforin, GranzB, GranzA,and FasL was not statistically di ﬀerent between the 2 ge-\nnotypes (eFigure 4). To investigate whether the increased\nlevels of IFN γin the supernatants were the consequence of\nan increased secretion at the cell level or an increased fre-\nquency of IFN γproducing CD8 T cells, we analyzed the\nIFNγexpression by ﬂow cytometry using intracytoplasmic\nstaining. Although there was only a tendency for an in-\ncreased proportion of cells producing IFN γ(Figure 4B), the\nIFNγMFI was increased in CD8 T cells expressing the\nNeurology.org/NN Neurology: Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation | Volume 11, Number 6 | November 2024\ne200306(5)\nCD226-307Ser variant (Figure 4C), suggesting that in-\ndividual CD8 T cells carrying the risk allele had a higherability to produce IFN γon activation with anti-CD3 and\nanti-CD28 mAbs. This result is in line with the positive\nregulation of the IFN γproduction pathway found in our\nRNAseq analysis and con ﬁrms the increased capacity of\nIFNγsecretion by CD8 T cells harboring the risk variant\nafter TCR activation.Risk Allele of CD226 Promotes IL-12R β2/STAT4/\nIFNγPathways in CD8 T Cells\nThe signaling pathways that contribute to IFN γproduction\nhave been well characterized. IFN γreceptor (IFNGR) sig-\nnaling activates the signal transducer and activator of tran-\nscription 1 (STAT1), which in turn induces the expression of\nT-BET in e ﬀector T cells.\n27This leads to the expression of the\nβ2 chain of IL-12 receptor (IL-12R β2) that induces theFigure 2 Transcriptomics of CD8 T Cells Carrying the Protective or the Risk Variant of CD226\nRNA sequencing of purified CD8 T cells from healthy donors homozygous for either the protective (CD226-307Gly, N = 10) or risk (CD226-307Ser, N = 10) al lele\nstimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs for 0 and 24 hours.
