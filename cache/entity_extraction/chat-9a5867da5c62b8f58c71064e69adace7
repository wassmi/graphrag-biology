There-\nfore, we generated HEK293T cell lines expressing PSMA4- miniTurbo or miniTurbo alone, enabling \nshorter biotinylation time thanks to the enhanced activity of miniTurbo as compared to BirA* (Branon \net al., 2018; Figure 4—figure supplement 1a and b). We tested biotinylation by PSMA4- miniTurbo \nusing immunoblot and confirmed that 2 hr were sufficient to achieve biotinylation levels comparable \nto the one PSMA4- BirA* after 24 hr of biotin supplementation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1c). \nFurthermore, we confirmed enrichment of proteasome members and interacting proteins (Figure 4—\nfigure supplement 1d), and observed positive correlation between the enrichments measured using \nPSMA4- miniTurbo and PSMA4- BirA*, relatively to their respective control lines (Figure  4—figure \nsupplement 1e). Applying the classifier algorithm, we identified 168 protein groups enriched for \nPSMA4- miniTurbo (FPR <0.05, Figure 4—figure supplement 1f and g).\nNext, we included a step of acute inhibition of the proteasome by the potent cell- permeable inhib-\nitor MG132 for 4 hr (Figure 4a). We confirmed proteasome inhibition by the accumulation of ubiq-\nuitylated proteins assessed by immunoblot (Figure 4—figure supplement 1h). Principal component (f) Cycloheximide- chase experiment on c- Myc stability. PSMA4- BirA*cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated times in \nthe presence or absence of MG132 (20 μM) and tetracycline (1 µg/µl). Cells lysates were then prepared for western blot analysis of steady- state levels of \nc- Myc.Tet=tetracycline, CHX = cycloheximide.\nThe online version of this article includes the following source data and figure supplement(s) for figure 2:\nSource data 1.
