While the function of ARMC6 is unknown, \nBRAT1 has been associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (Srivastava \net al., 2016) and shown to play a role in DNA damage response (So and Ouchi, 2011) and RNA \nprocessing (Cihlarova et al., 2022). TIGD5 encodes protein with DNA- binding features. Although its \nexact function is not established, it has been suggested to operate as a tumor suppressor in ovarian \ncancer (Dai et al., 2022). We then performed a cycloheximide chase experiment and could validate \nthem as proteasome substrates (Figure 4g and Figure 4—figure supplement 1j).\nFinally, we investigated whether we could use ProteasomeID to identify selective induction of \nprotein degradation by small molecules. For this purpose, we used KB02- JQ1, a well- characterized \nPROTAC that targets bromodomain- containing proteins (BRDs) for proteasomal degradation (Zhang \net al., 2019). We pre- treated cells with KB02- JQ1 for 8 hr prior to proteasome inhibition and biotin \nsupplementation (Figure 5a). Mass spectrometry analysis showed global changes induced by KB02- \nJQ1 either in presence or absence of MG132, as indicated by PCA (Figure 4—figure supplement 1k). \nImportantly, we could detect prominent enrichment of BRD containing proteins following treatment \nwith KB02- JQ1 (Figure 5b and Supplementary file 4). The effect was more pronounced for BRD2 \nand BRD3 and less striking for BRD4 (Figure 5c), presumably reflecting different kinetics of induced \ndegradation by KB02- JQ1 (Zhang et al., 2019). Notably, the enrichment of BRD2 and BRD3 was also \ndetectable in absence of MG132, in contrast to endogenous substrates that become enriched only \nfollowing proteasome inhibition (Figure 5c). Together, these data demonstrate that ProteasomeID \ncan be used to detect both endogenous and protein degrader- induced substrates of the proteasome \nin cultured cells.\nA mouse model for in vivo ProteasomeID\nHaving established and validated proximity labeling of proteasomes in a cell culture model, we \ndesigned a strategy to implement ProteasomeID in a mouse model (Figure 6a). The mouse model \nwas designed to express the 20 S proteasome core particle PSMA4 fused to the biotinylating enzyme \nminiTurbo and a FLAG tag for the detection of the fusion protein. We chose miniTurbo instead of BirA* \nbecause of its higher biotinylating efficiency (Branon et al., 2018). PSMA4- miniTurbo was inserted in PIPs. Enrichment levels were normalized to the levels detected in BirA* control cell line which was set to 1. Protein quantities were derived from DIA \nmass spectrometry data. Data are shown as mean ± standard error from n=4 biological replicates.(g) Network analysis of 608 interactors of PSMA4- \nBirA* obtained by ProteasomeID. Identified proteins were filtered for significance by a cutoff of log2 fold change >1 and Q value <0.05 in relation to \nBirA* control. Nodes representing identified proteins that are known PIPs or members of ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (left network) or identified \nprotein and their first interacting neighbor are known PIPs or members of UPS (right network) are highlighted in red color. Edges represent high \nconfidence (>0.7) protein- protein interactions derived from the STRING database (Snel et al., 2000).Figure 3 continued\n\n Tools and resources      \nBiochemistry and Chemical Biology\nBartolome et al. eLife 2024;13:RP93256.
