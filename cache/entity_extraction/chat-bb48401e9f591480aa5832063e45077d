However, owing to the suboptimal quality of the included studies, more high-quality \nand large-scale RCTs are needed for comprehensive analysis and further validation.\nIntroduction\nAlopecia areata (AA) is a common chronic tissue-specific autoim -\nmune disease that is characterized by patchy hair loss on the scalp \n[1]. AA affects up to 2% of the general population, irrespective of \nage, race, or sex [ 2]. It is often considered a cosmetic problem, but \nit can cause an enormous psychological burden on patients, seri -\nously affecting their daily life and self-esteem [ 3]. Topical therapy \nis used as a first-line therapy for alopecia, and topical minoxidil \nhas beed the only FDA-approved over-the-counter drug uesd to \ntreat androgenetic alopecia for over 30 years [ 4]. It has been used \nto treat many other types of alopecia, including AA, since its \napproval. It can slow hair loss by prolonging the growth period \nand promote hair regeneration by increasing hair diameter and density. Notably, the efficacy of topical minoxidil as a monother -\napy is unsatisfactory. Multiple studies have shown that combina -\ntion therapy can achieve better clinical efficacy [ 5]. Therefore, we \naimed to collect the relevant published literature, evaluate the \nefficacy of combination therapy on AA, and provide a new alter -\nnative therapy for AA.\nThe compound glycyrrhizin (CG) has anti-inflammatory, \nanti-allergic and immunomodulatory effects, and can exert \nglucocorticoid-like effects safely [ 6]. CG enhances the activity of \nlymphocytes by promoting the activation of NK cells and T cells, \nthereby inhibiting the progression of AA, inhibiting phospholipase \nactivity, and exerting antimicrobial effects to promote new hair \ngrowth [ 7]. In recent years, clinical research on the combination of \nCG and topical minoxidil for treating AA has gradually increased, \n© 2024 the a uthor(s).
