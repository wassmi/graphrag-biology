These proteasome variants are considered constitutive and they are \ngenerated in most of the cells. In addition to the 19S regulatory particles, the core particle can be \nassociated with different alternative regulatory complexes including the proteasome activator PA200 \n(named PSME4 in mammals) or three different versions of the 11S regulator complex PA28 – PA28α \n(PSME1), PA28β (PSME2), and PA28γ (PSME3). These are ATP- independent proteasome regulators \nthat modulate proteasome activity towards small peptides and unfolded proteins and can facilitate \nprotein degradation independent of ubiquitin (Toste Rêgo and da Fonseca, 2019; Mao et al., 2008).\nThe composition of cellular proteasomes can be heterogeneous due to the assembly of distinct \nsub- complexes in variable stoichiometries, and to the incorporation of tissue/cell type specific compo-\nnents. Specialized proteasomes have been described in immune cells, thymus, sperm cells (Abi Habib \net al., 2022), and cancer (Javitt et al., 2023). Sub- populations of proteasomes have been shown to \nbe located in different cellular compartments including inner nuclear membrane (Albert et al., 2017), \nendoplasmic reticulum (Albert et al., 2020), Golgi apparatus (Eisenberg- Lerner et al., 2020), plasma \nmembranes (Ramachandran and Margolis, 2017), primary cilia Gerhardt et al., 2016, and protein \naggregates (Guo et al., 2018). Moreover, the assembly state of proteasomes and their biophysical \nproperties can be modulated in response to, for example hyperosmotic stress (Yasuda et al., 2020) or \namino acid starvation (Uriarte et al., 2021).\nDue to the dynamic nature of proteasome composition and its distribution within cells, it is important \nto employ analytical approaches that can capture protein- protein interactions across different cellular \ncompartments and account for transient interactions. Traditional methods such as co- immunoprecip-\nitation, affinity purification or cell fractionation coupled to mass spectrometry have been valuable in \nstudying proteasome interactions (Fabre et al., 2013; Fabre et al., 2015; Bousquet- Dubouch et al., \n2009; Geladaki et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2007), but they may not capture transient or weak interac-\ntions. To address this limitation, proximity labeling assays, such as BioID or APEX, utilize engineered \nproteins that can biotinylate neighboring proteins in close proximity within the cellular context, and \nthereby enable a more comprehensive and dynamic characterization of protein- protein interactions \n(Gingras et al., 2019).\nHere, we present an approach named ProteasomeID that enables the quantification of proteasome \ninteracting proteins and substrates in cultured human cells and mouse models. The approach entails \nfusing the proteasome with promiscuous biotin ligases, which are incorporated into fully assembled \nproteasomes without affecting their activity. The ligases label proteins with biotin that come into \nproximity (~10 nm) of the tagged proteasome subunit. Biotinylated proteins are then captured from \ncell or tissue lysates using an optimized streptavidin enrichment protocol and analyzed by deep Data \nIndependent Acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry. We show that ProteasomeID can quantitatively \nmonitor the majority of proteasome interacting proteins both in situ and in vivo in mice, and iden-\ntify novel proteasome interacting proteins. In addition, when combined with proteasome inhibition, \nProteasomeID enables the identification of proteasome substrates, including low abundant transcrip-\ntion factors.\nResults\nDesign of a proximity labeling strategy to monitor proteasome \ninteractions\nFirst, we tested multiple locations of the biotin ligase to ensure that the integration within the prote-\nasome complex would not impede its assembly or disrupt its functionality. Based on previous studies \nwhere proteasome members were tagged with fluorescent proteins in mammalian cells (Salomons \net al., 2010; Bingol and Schuman, 2006), we fused the promiscuous biotin ligase BirA* either to \nthe C- termini of the 20 S core particle protein PSMA4/ɑ3, the 19 S particle base protein PSMC2/\n\n Tools and resources      \nBiochemistry and Chemical Biology\nBartolome et al. eLife 2024;13:RP93256.
