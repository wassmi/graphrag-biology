Altered proteasome activity has been linked to neurodegeneration, \nauto- immune disorders and cancer. Despite the relevance for human disease and drug develop-\nment, no method currently exists to monitor proteasome composition and interactions in vivo in \nanimal models. To fill this gap, we developed a strategy based on tagging of proteasomes with \npromiscuous biotin ligases and generated a new mouse model enabling the quantification of prote-\nasome interactions by mass spectrometry. We show that biotin ligases can be incorporated in fully \nassembled proteasomes without negative impact on their activity. We demonstrate the utility of our \nmethod by identifying novel proteasome- interacting proteins, charting interactomes across mouse \norgans, and showing that proximity- labeling enables the identification of both endogenous and \nsmall- molecule- induced proteasome substrates.\neLife assessment\nThis study presents an important method and resource in cell lines and in mice for mass \nspectrometry- based identification of interactors of the proteasome, a multi- protein complex with a \ncentral role in protein turnover in almost all tissues and cell types. The method presented, including \nthe experimental workflow and analysis pipeline, as well as the several lines of validation provided \nthroughout, is convincing. Given the growing interest in protein aggregation and targeted protein \ndegradation modalities, this work will be of interest to a broad spectrum of basic cell biologists and \ntranslational researchers.\nIntroduction\nThe ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is a major selective protein degradation system of eukary-\notic cells (Schmidt and Finley, 2014). Proteasomes influence crucial processes in the cell including \nprotein homeostasis, DNA repair, signal transduction and immune responses (Rousseau and Berto-\nlotti, 2018) by degrading a multitude of regulatory, short- lived, damaged and misfolded proteins \n(Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002; Abildgaard et al., 2020). Impairment of proteasome function has \nbeen described to occur during aging Saez and Vilchez, 2014 and in neurodegenerative diseases \nTanaka and Matsuda, 2014; Schmidt and Finley, 2014, and high expression levels of proteasome \nsubunits have been linked to longevity in different species including worms (Vilchez et al., 2012), fish \n(Kelmer Sacramento et al., 2020), and flies (Tonoki et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2019). While partial \nproteasome inhibition is sufficient to induce cellular senescence (Chondrogianni et al., 2003; Chon-\ndrogianni and Gonos, 2004), prolonged inhibition of the proteasome induces apoptosis (Abbas and TOOLS AND RESOURCES\n*For correspondence: \ntherese.dau@leibniz-fli.de (TD); \nalessandro.ori@leibniz-fli.de (AO)\n†These authors contributed \nequally to this work\nCompeting interest: See page \n21\nFunding: See page 22\nPreprint posted\n30 September 2023\nSent for Review\n23 October 2023\nReviewed preprint posted\n30 January 2024\nReviewed preprint revised\n01 May 2024\nVersion of Record published\n04 September 2024\nReviewing Editor: Nicolas \nLehrbach, Fred Hutchinson \nCancer Research Center, United \nStates\n   Copyright Bartolome et al. \nThis article is distributed under \nthe terms of the Creative \nCommons Attribution License, \nwhich permits unrestricted use \nand redistribution provided that \nthe original author and source \nare credited.\n\n Tools and resources      \nBiochemistry and Chemical Biology\nBartolome et al. eLife 2024;13:RP93256.

This has been exploited in cancer therapies, for example against blood cancers, as \ncancer cells are especially sensitive to proteotoxic stress (Manasanch and Orlowski, 2017). Further -\nmore, the role of proteasomes extends beyond the degradation of proteins. In the immune system, \npeptide generation by specialized immunoproteasomes regulates antigen presentation and has been \nlinked to auto- immune disorders (Feist et al., 2016).\nThe eukaryotic proteasome consists of two subcomplexes: the ‘core particle’ (20 S proteasome) \nthat can be present either alone or in association with one (26 S proteasome) or two 19 S ‘regulatory \nparticles’ (30  S proteas\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
