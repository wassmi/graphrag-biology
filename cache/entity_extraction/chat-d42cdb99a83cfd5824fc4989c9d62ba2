ProteasomeID identifies known and novel endogenous proteasome substrates. (a) Scheme of ProteasomeID workflow in HEK293T cells \nincluding proteasome inhibition by MG132. PSMA4- miniTurbo expression and incorporation into proteasomes is achieved by 4- day induction with \ntetracycline. Proteasome inhibition is achieved by addition of 20 µM MG132 4 hr before cell harvesting. Biotin substrate for miniTurbo is supplied 2 hr \nbefore cell harvesting. D: day; hr: hour; Tet: tetracycline; Bio: biotin. (b) Enriched proteins from ProteasomeID cells treated with proteasome inhibitor \nMG132 compared to vehicle control. The subset of proteins enriched exclusively upon MG132 treatment are highlighted in dark blue. Data were \nobtained from n=4 biological replicates. (c) Profile of proteins exclusively enriched upon MG132 treatment of ProteasomeID cells (pie chart). Identified \nproteins are represented by proteasome/ubiquitin related proteins, known proteasome substrates and potential previously unidentified substrates. \nThe number of proteins identified by this approach for which previous studies showed increased ubiquitylation upon proteasome inhibition is shown in \nthe lower bar plot. (d) Bar plots comparing the levels of proteasome activators and ubiquitin, and known proteasome substrates following streptavidin \nenrichment from different cell lines and following proteasome inhibition by MG132. Protein quantities were derived from DIA mass spectrometry data. \nmT: miniTurbo control cell line; A4- mT: PSMA4- miniTurbo cell line; I: proteasome inhibition by MG132. Data are shown as mean ± standard error from \nn=4 biological replicates. (e) Distribution of log2 fold changes following MG132 treatment for candidate and known proteasome substrates identified \nby ProteasomeID. The fold changes are compared to the other identified proteins using total proteome (left) or ProteasomeID data (right). *** p<0.001 \nWilcoxon Rank Sum test with continuity correction. (f) Bar plots comparing the levels of three potential novel proteasome substrate proteins following \nstreptavidin enrichment from different cell lines and following proteasome inhibition by MG132. Protein quantities were derived from DIA mass \nspectrometry data. mT: miniTurbo control cell line; A4- mT: PSMA4- miniTurbo cell line; I: proteasome inhibition by MG132. Data are shown as mean \n± standard error from n=4 biological replicates. (g) Cycloheximide- chase experiment on stability of 3 potential novel proteasome substrate proteins. \nHEK293T cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated times in the presence or absence of MG132 (20 μM). Cell lysates \nwere then prepared for western blot analysis of steady- state levels of c- Myc, ARMC6, BRAT1, and TIGD5. c- Myc was used as a positive control as it is a \nwell known proteasome substrate. Densitometric quantification of the bands from the assay are shown\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
