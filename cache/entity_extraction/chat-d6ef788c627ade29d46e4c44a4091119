Cell lysates \nwere then prepared for western blot analysis of steady- state levels of c- Myc, ARMC6, BRAT1, and TIGD5. c- Myc was used as a positive control as it is a \nwell known proteasome substrate. Densitometric quantification of the bands from the assay are shown in bar plots. For quantification, bands were first \nnormalized to GAPDH as a loading control and subsequently normalized to zero hour, untreated samples (set to 1).

This line carries a cassette encoding the rtTA3 transactivator and the \nfluorescent protein mKate on the Rosa 26 locus under the control of a CAG promoter. Importantly, a \nLoxP- stop- LoxP cassette is present between the CAG promoter and the rtTA3 and mKate expressing \ncassette, enabling tissue- specific expression via crossing to specific CRE lines. The engineered D34 \nline was used to generate a mouse line via blastocyst injection. For proof of concept, we crossed the \nTRE- Psma4- miniTurbo;Rosa26- CAGs- RIK line with a CMV- Cre line that expresses constitutively the \nCRE recombinase in all tissues (Nagy, 2000). The obtained TRE- Psma4- miniTurbo;Rosa26- CAGs- RIK \nline was back crossed to C57BL/6 J to remove the CMV- Cre allele. The obtained mouse line consti-\ntutively expresses the rtTA3 transactivator, thereby enabling doxycycline inducible expression of the \nPSMA4- miniTurbo construct in all tissues.\nWe evaluated the induction of PSMA4- miniTurbo in different organs (kidney, liver, heart, skeletal \nmuscle and brain) by feeding mice with doxycycline containing food for 10 or 31 days. We observed \nno significant changes in body weight nor any sign of suffering (Figure  6b). Immunoblot analysis \nconfirmed expression of PSMA4- miniTurbo in all organs except the brain (Figure 6—figure supple-\nment 1a). The locus used for PSMA4- miniTurbo expression (Col1a1) is known to be active in all \nthe organs tested (Lee, 2014), however the limited penetration of food- administered doxycycline \n(Gengenbacher et al., 2020) limits the usability of our approach in the brain. The temporal dynamics \nof induction varied between organs. While 10 days of induction were sufficient to achieve PSMA4- \nminiTurbo protein levels comparable to endogenous PSMA4 in the kidney, other organs required \n31 days. In most organs, the expression levels of PSMA4- miniTurbo were comparable to the one of \nendogenous PSMA4, with the exception of the skeletal muscle. In this organ, the levels of PSMA4- \nminiTurbo exceeded the endogenous PSMA4, suggesting the existence of a more prominent pool \nof not incorporated PSMA4- miniTurbo. Based on these observations, we decided to proceed with Figure supplement 1.
