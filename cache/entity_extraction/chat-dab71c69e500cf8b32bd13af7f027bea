Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and lysates were prepared by soni-\ncation in Bioruptor Plus sonication device (Diagenode). The following steps were performed as \nindicated previously, but using a different buffer to check the efficiency of the proteins to the \nmembrane (amido black solution 0.25% (w/v), naphthol blue black, 45% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) \nacetic acid, in milliQ water). After the ECL reaction, membranes were visualized on a CL- XPo-\nsure Film (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34090), using an Amersham Hypercassette Autoradiography \nCassette (RPN11648).\nProteasome activity assay\nThe proteasome activity assay (PAA) was performed using the 20 S proteasome activity assay kit (Milli-\npore, APT280) following the manufacturer instructions. In short, cell pellets were thawed in ice- cold \nlysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X- 100, 2 mM ATP) and \nleft on ice for 30 min with short vortex steps every 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 20,817 x g, for \n15 min at 4 °C to remove any debris. For protein amount estimation the EZQ Protein Quantitation Kit \nwas used. 50 μg of protein extract were incubated with fluorophore- linked peptide substrate (LLVY- 7- \namino- 4- methylcoumarin, AMC) for 60 min at 37 °C. Proteasome activity was measured by quantifica-\ntion of fluorescent units from cleaved AMC at 380/460 nm using a microplate reader m1000 (Tecan).\n\n Tools and resources      \nBiochemistry and Chemical Biology\nBartolome et al. eLife 2024;13:RP93256. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.93256  16 of 32Cycloheximide chase assay\nHEK293T cells were seeded in six- well plates (300 k cells per well). The cells were simultaneously incu-\nbated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0, 4, 8, and 12 hr in the presence or absence of 20 μM MG132 \nproteasome inhibitor. To induce expression of the construct (PSMA4- BirA*), cells were exposed to \n1 µg/µl of tetracycline. Cells were then harvested as described above. Cell pellets were then prepared \nby the same method and lysis buffer described in Proteasome activity assay for western blot analysis. \nTen µg of total proteins, determined by use of EZQ Protein Quantitation Kit, per lane were separated \non SDS PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting on anti- c- myc, anti- ARMC6, anti- BRAT1, anti- TIGD5 \nand anti- GAPDH antibodies. The intensity of the bands were analyzed with the Image Lab software \n(v6.0.1, Bio- Rad Laboratories, Inc).\nNative gel electrophoresis\nPellets of one million HEK293T cells containing an estimated 100 µg of total protein were collected. \nThe pellets were then lysed in the same lysis buffer and in the same conditions as used for Proteasome \nactivity assay. Following this, the samples were transferred into fresh tubes and 50 µg of each sample \nwas subjected to native gel electrophoresis to reveal the various proteasome complexes (30 S, 26 S, \n20 S) using a NativePAGE 3 to 12% Bis- Tris gel (Invitrogen, BN1001BOX) in XCell SureLock Mini- Cell \nsystem (Invitrogen). Appropriate running buffers for native page were used (NativePAGE Running \nBuffer Kit, Invitrogen, BN2007) with addition of providing 2 mM ATP in buffers coming into direct \ncontact with the gel. The gel was run for 60 min at 4   °C with constant 150   V, followed by voltage \nincrease to 250 V and continued to run for another 90 min. Proteins in native gels were transferred \nto nitrocellulose membranes for 2   hr at 28 V, 0.11 mA, at 4   °C, by using wet transfer buffer (48 mM \nTris, 390 mM Glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 20% Methanol). The membranes were then blocked in 3% BSA, \n0.5% TBST and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies against PSMA4 (1:250 dilution), FLAG M2 \n(1\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
