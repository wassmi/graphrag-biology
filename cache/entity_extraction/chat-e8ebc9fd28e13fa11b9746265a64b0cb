DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.93256  3 of 32Rpt1 or the N- terminus of the 19 S particle lid protein PSMD3/Rpn3 (Figure 1a and Figure 1—figure \nsupplement 1a). Each construct also contained a FLAG tag for fusion protein detection. We used \nthese constructs to generate stable HEK293 FlpIn TREx (HEK293T) cell lines that overexpress the \nBirA* fusion proteins under the control of a tetracycline inducible promoter. A cell line expressing \nonly the BirA* protein was used as a control to account for non specific biotinylation. We confirmed \ntetracycline- dependent expression of the corresponding cell lines by anti- FLAG immunoblot, and \nconfirmed biotinylating activity following supplementation of exogenous biotin using streptavi-\ndin- HRP blot (Figure 1b). These results were validated by immunofluorescence analysis (Figure 1c \nand Figure 1—figure supplement 1b).\nIn order to identify the most suitable fusion protein for proximity labeling of proteasomes, we \ncompared the enrichment of proteasome components in streptavidin pull downs performed with \ndifferent cell lines that we generated. We optimized a BioID protocol that we previously developed \n(Mackmull et al., 2017) to improve the identification of biotinylated proteins by liquid chromatog-\nraphy tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS). Briefly, the protocol entails the capture of biotinylated \nproteins from cell lysates using streptavidin beads followed by enzymatic on- bead digestion and anal-\nysis of the resulting peptides by LC- MS/MS. We introduced chemical modification of streptavidin \nbeads and changed the protease digestion strategy to reduce streptavidin contamination following \non- bead digestion (Figure 1—figure supplement 2a). In addition, we improved the data analysis \nby implementing Data Independent Acquisition (DIA). These optimizations allowed us to drastically \nreduce (>fourfold) the background from streptavidin- derived peptides (Figure 1—figure supplement \n2b and c), and to increase more than twofold the number of identified proteins and biotinylated \npeptides in our BioID experiments (Figure 1—figure supplement 2d).\nUsing this optimized BioID protocol, we analyzed samples enriched from cell lines expressing \nPSMA4- BirA*, PSMC2- BirA*, BirA*-PSMD3 or BirA* control (Figure  1—figure supplement 2e). \nWe found significant enrichment of proteasome subunits for each of the cell lines expressing BirA* \nfusion proteins compared to BirA* control (Figure 1—figure supplement 2f and Supplementary file \n1). However, the pattern of enrichment varied between fusion proteins (Figure 1d and e). PSMA4- \nBirA* provided the strongest enrichment for 20 S proteins, but also a prominent enrichment of other \nproteasome components (typically  >4  fold), while PSMC2- BirA* enriched preferentially 19  S base \nproteins. BirA*-PSMD3 displayed a more homogenous, but less pronounced enrichment of protea-\nsome proteins (typically ~twofold). The different enrichment patterns reflect the localization of the \nfusion proteins within the complex, but it might also indicate interference of the biotin ligase with the \nassembly of the proteasome, especially in the case of PSMC2- BirA*. Consequently, we decided to \nfocus on the PSMA4- BirA* fusion protein for further characterization as it showed an overall stronger \nenrichment of proteasomal proteins from both the 20 S and 19 S particles.\nPSMA4-BirA* is incorporated into fully assembled proteasomes and \ndoes not interfere with their proteolytic activity\nNext, we performed a series of experiments to confirm the incorporation of PSMA4- BirA* into fully \nassembled proteasomes and exclude any potential interference with their proteolytic activity. Since \nthe BirA* fusion protein is over- expressed using a CMV promoter, we first confirmed that the abun-\ndance levels of PSMA4- BirA* are comparable to the ones of the endogenous PSMA4 using an anti- \nPSMA4 immunoblot (Figure 2a and Figure 2—figure supplement 1a).\nIn order to assess the assembly of PSMA4- BirA* into proteasome complexes, we performed size \nexclusion chromatography coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry (SEC- MS) analysis of the cell \nline expressing PSMA4- BirA* following induction by tetracycline. Protein elution profiles built from \nmass spectrometry data obtained from 32 SEC fractions revealed three major distinct peaks corre-\nsponding to the major assembly states of the proteasome (Supplementary file 2). These include 30 S \nproteasomes, containing a core particle capped with two regulatory particles, 26  S proteasomes, \ncontaining a core particle capped with 1 regulatory particle, and isolated core particles (20 S prote-\nasomes; Figure 2b and Figure 2—figure supplement 1b).
