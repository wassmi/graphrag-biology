Our study aimed to \nsystematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of compound glycyrrhizin (CG) combined with topical \nminoxidil therapy in treating AA.\nMethods:  We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and \nVIP databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy \ncompared with topical minoxidil therapy alone for AA were included. The Cochrane Collaborative \nNetwork Tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Statistical analysis was completed using RevMan5.3 \nsoftware and Stata 15.0 software. The GRADE system was used to evaluate the quality of evidence for \noutcomes.\nResult:  11 RCTs and 1189 patients were included. Compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, CG \ncombined with topical minoxidil therapy was more effective at improving the clinical efficacy (RR = \n1.36, 95% CI [1.27, 1.45], p < 0.00001). The SALT score (MD = −10.09, 95% CI [−12.89, −7.30], p < 0.00001), \nserum TNF-α levels (MD = −0.99, 95% CI [−1.19, −0.39], p < 0.00001), serum IL-12 levels (MD = −8.84, \n95% CI [−11.20, −6.47], p < 0.00001) and serum IFN-γ levels (MD = −7.44, 95% CI [−11.51, −3.37], \np = 0.0003) were reduced, and the serum TGF-β1 levels (MD = 2.40, 95% CI [1.24, 3.57], p < 0.0001) were \nincreased. There were no significant differences in reported adverse events, including irritant contact \ndermatitis (RR = 0.51, 95% CI [0.25, 1.01], p = 0.05), ’ gastrointestinal reactions (RR = 2.47, 95% CI [0.49, \n12.55], p = 0.28), lower limb edema (RR = 2.60, 95% CI [0.61, 11.06], p = 0.20), facial edema (RR = 2.33, \n95% CI [0.61, 8.93], p = 0.22), or localized itching (RR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.18, 1.75], p = 0.32), between the \ntwo groups.\nConclusion:  The current evidence indicates that CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy is effective \nand safe for AA. However, owing to the suboptimal quality of the included studies, more high-quality \nand large-scale RCTs are\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
