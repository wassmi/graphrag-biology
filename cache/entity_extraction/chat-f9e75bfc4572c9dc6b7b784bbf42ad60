DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.93256  5 of 32of PSMA4- BirA* into assembled proteasomes, and to demonstrate that the assembly of proteasomes \nis not affected by the overexpression of PSMA4- BirA* (Figure 2c). Finally, we used our mass spectrom-\netry data to identify sites of protein biotinylation in PSMA4- BirA* expressing cells. By mapping the \nidentified sites on the proteasome structure, we could confirm the specificity of protein biotinylation \nby showing that 25 out of 26 residues identified as biotinylated by PSMA4- BirA* are located less than \n10 nm away from the C- terminus of PSMA4 (Figure 2d and Supplementary file 2). Importantly, 18 of \nthese sites were located on proteins from the 19 S regulatory particle, further supporting the incorpo-\nration of PSMA4- BirA* into assembled proteasomes.\nIn order to test the influence of BirA* fusion proteins on proteasome function, we measured prote-\nasome chymotrypsin- like activity in cell lysates from BirA* expressing cell lines in presence or absence \nof tetracycline. We observed a slight, not- significant reduction of proteasome activity (~15–20%) \nfollowing addition of tetracycline that was comparable between cell lines expressing proteasome \nPSMA4- BirA* or BirA* control (Figure 2e). In addition, we tested the impact of PSMA4- BirA* overex-\npression on the degradation of c- Myc, a known proteasome substrate, using a cycloheximide chase \nexperiment. We showed that tetracycline- mediated induction of PSMA4- BirA* did not have a major \neffect on the degradation kinetics of c- Myc (Figure 2f and Figure 2—figure supplement 1c). Also, \nlevels of K48- ubiquitylated proteins were not affected (Figure 2—figure supplement 1d), further \nconfirming that PSMA4- BirA* has no major impact on the proteolytic activity of the proteasome in \ncells.\nProteasomeID retrieves proteasome subunits, assembly factors and \nknown proteasome interactors\nTo assess the ability of ProteasomeID to retrieve known proteasome interacting proteins (PIPs) in \naddition to proteasome components, we implemented a logistic regression classifier algorithm \n(Figure  3a). The classifier is based on an ‘Enrichment score’ that we obtained by combining the \naverage log2 ratio and the negative logarithm of the q value from differential protein abundance \nanalysis performed vs. BirA* control line. We then used a set of true positives, here, proteasome \nmembers, and true negatives, here, mitochondrial matrix proteins, which should not interact directly \nwith the proteasome under homeostatic conditions, to identify a cut- off for defining ProteasomeID- \nenriched proteins at a controlled false positive rate (Figure 3b). We validated the classifier using a \nreceiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis (Figure 2—figure supplement 1e). Using the classifier, \nwe identified 608 protein groups enriched by ProteasomeID for the PSMA4- BirA* dataset (false posi-\ntive rate, FPR <0.05, Figure 3c and Supplementary file 3).\nWe investigated the occurrence of PIPs among ProteasomeID- enriched proteins using the two \napproaches. First, we compared the BioID data from PSMA4- BirA* to the SEC- MS data obtained \nfrom the same cell line. We could show that SEC elution profiles of proteins enriched in ProteasomeID \ntend to have significantly higher correlation with the elution profile of PSMA4 (Figure  3d). Since \ncorrelated SEC elution profiles are typically interpreted as an indication of physical association in this \ntype of experiment, these data suggest that ProteasomeID can enrich PIPs. Second, we compared \nour dataset to these three previous proteomic studies that investigate PIPs using complementary any substance (- tet -bio), with addition of only tetracycline for 4 days (+tet bio) or with addition of both tetracycline for 4 days and biotin for 1 day (+tet \n+ bio).
