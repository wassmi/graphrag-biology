(2) The recognized diagnostic \ncriteria had to be reported in the included studies, with no restric -\ntions on the clinical types of AA, age, race, and gender of patients. \n(3) The experimental intervention applied CG combined with topi -\ncal minoxidil therapy. The control group received the same topical \nminoxidil as the experimental group. (4) The main outcome mea -\nsures were Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score [ 9, 10] and clini -\ncal efficacy. The clinical efficacy with specific definitions at home \nand abroad were all accepted [ 11, 12], which can divide into clin -\nical cure, marked efficacy, effective and no efficacy. Clinical cure is \ndefined by all new hair grows out, densely distributed, with hair \nthickness and color similar to normal hair. Marked efficacy is \ndefined by new hair grows by 50% to 99%, with a significant \namount of velvety hair turning into coarse hair. We define the \nnumber of patients with clinical efficacy = number of \"clinically \ncured\" patients + number of \"marked efficacy\" patients. Secondary \noutcomes were serum TNF-α, TGF-β1, IL-12, IFN-γ levels and \nadverse reactions.\nExclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Studies about AA but \nmixed with other illnesses. (2) Non-RCTs, such as reviews, case \nreports and conference abstracts. (3) Unable to obtain full-text or \ndata or duplicate published research.\nData extraction\nTwo researchers (Gu XR and Li JC) extracted the following data \nseparately for all studies meeting the inclusion criteria inde -\npendently: study characteristics (including first author, country and \nyear of publication), baseline data (including age, gender, sample \nsize and disease course), intervention measures (dose and fre -\nquency of CG, usage of minoxidil) and outcome data. All the \nextracted data were cross-checked. Any disagreements arising during this process were discussed and addressed with the third \nresearcher (Guo CQ).\nAssessment of risk of bias\nTwo researchers (Wang YD and Yang GJ) used the quality evalua -\ntion criteria provided in the Cochrane Intervention System \nEvaluation Manual to evaluate the basic risk of the included liter -\nature [ 13]. Seven evaluation items were evaluated: random \nsequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of investi -\ngators and/or subjects, blinding of study results evaluators, integ -\nrity of results data, selective reporting, and other bias. Each items \nwas classified as having a low, unclear or high risk of bias. Any \nagreement was resolved by the third researcher (Guo CQ).\nGRADE evaluation\nThe GRADE system is used to evaluate the quality of evidence for \noutcomes [ 14]. The degradation factors mainly include five aspects: \nrisk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other con -\nsiderations. The quality definition is classified as extremely low \nquality evidence (+), low quality evidence (++), medium quality \nevidence (+++), and high quality evidence (++++).\nStatistical analysis\nRevMan 5.3 software was used for data analysis. The dichotomous \noutcomes were expressed as risk ratio (RR), the continuous out -\ncomes were analyzed using the mean difference (MD), and each \neffect size was expressed as a 95% confidence interval (CI). \nHeterogeneity was evaluated using the χ2 test and I2 test. When \np > 0.1 and I2 < 50%, a fixed-effects model was selected for the \nmeta-analysis. Otherwise, a fixed-effects model should be adopted. \nSubgroup analyses were used based on study design if possible. In \naddition, STATA 15.0 was used for sensitivity analysis to explore \npotential sources of heterogeneity. A funnel plot for evaluating \npublication bias was employed if the number of included studies \nwas ≥ 10.\nResult\nLiterature retrieval\nA total of 196 studies were retrieved from the 7 electronic data -\nbases, and 101 duplicates were removed. Then, after reading the \ntitles and abstracts of the remaining 95 studies, we further \nexcluded an additional 67 irrelevant studies. Next, after reading \nthe full text of the remaining 28 studies, 17 studies were further \nexcluded. Finally, 11 studies were included in this work [ 15–25 ]. \n(Figure 1 )\nCharacteristics of the included studies\n11 RCTs included in this work were published between 2009 and \n2021, all of which were conducted in China. A total of 1189 par -\nticipants were involved ( n = 603 and n = 586 from the experimental \ngroup and control groups, separately). In each study, the dosage \nof CG was 3 times daily applications with 50–75 mg per applica -\ntion. For the concentration of minoxidil, 9 studies used 5% and the JOURNAL  OF DERMATOLOGICAL  TREATMENT 3\nremained 2 studies were 2%. The treatment course is 2 or 3 months. \nThe characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1 .\nRisk of bias\nThree studies [ 15, 17, 19] reported the use of random number \ntables, one study [ 21] reported the order of entering the hospital, \nand the other studies did not report their detailed randomization \ngeneration approach.
