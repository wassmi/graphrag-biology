The treatment course is 2 or 3 months. \nThe characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1 .\nRisk of bias\nThree studies [ 15, 17, 19] reported the use of random number \ntables, one study [ 21] reported the order of entering the hospital, \nand the other studies did not report their detailed randomization \ngeneration approach. None of the included studies reported allo -\ncation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel or \nblinding of outcome assessments. Other potential biases men -\ntioned in included studies were unclear due to limited informa -\ntion. The results of the bias risk evaluation are presented in \nFigure 2 .\nClinical efficacy\nEleven studies [ 15–25 ] involving 1189 patients reported clinical \nefficacy. A fixed-effects model was chosen in line with heteroge -\nneous results ( I2=0%, p = 0.99). According to the results of a \nmeta-analysis, the combination of CG and topical minoxidil ther -\napy could improve clinical efficacy compared with that of topical \nminoxidil therapy alone (RR = 1.36, 95% CI [1.27, 1.45], p < 0.00001). \nA subgroup analysis was performed for the treatment course. The clinical efficacy in the CG with a course of 2 months plus topical \nminoxidil group was better than that in the topical minoxidil alone \ngroup (RR = 1.46, 95% CI [1.21, 1.76], p < 0.0001). The similar result \ncan be observed at a course of 3 months (RR = 1.34, 95% CI [1.25, \n1.43], p < 0.00001) ( Figure 3 ).\nSAL T score\nFive studies [ 15, 17, 19, 21, 22] involving 585 participants reported \nSALT scores. A random-effects model was chosen in line with het -\nerogeneous results ( I2=97%, p < 0.0001). According to the results of \na meta-analysis, compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, \nCG combined with topical minoxidil therapy significantly reduced \nthe SALT score (MD = −10.09, 95% CI [−12.89, −7.30], p < 0.00001) \n(Figure 4 ).\nSerum TNF-α levels\nTwo studies [ 15, 19] involving 230 participants reported serum TNF-α \nlevels. A fixed-effects model was chosen in line with heterogeneous \nresults ( I2=0%, p = 0.70). According to the results of a meta-analysis, \ncompared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, CG combined with \ntopical minoxidil therapy significantly reduced the serum TNF-α levels \n(MD = −0.99, 95% CI [−1.19, −0.39], p < 0.00001) ( Figure 5 ).\nFigure 1.  Study selection process.4 C. GUO ET AL.\nSerum TGF-β1 levels\nThree studies [ 15, 16, 19] involving 319 participants reported \nserum TGF-β1 levels. A fixed-effects model was chosen in line with \nheterogeneous results ( I2=0%, p = 0.88). According to the results of \na meta-analysis, compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, \nCG combined with topical minoxidil therapy significantly increased \nthe serum TGF-β1 levels (MD = 2.40, 95% CI [1.24, 3.57], p < 0.0001) \n(Figure 6 ).\nSerum IL-12 levels\nTwo studies [ 15, 19] involving 230 participants reported serum IL-12 \nlevels. A fixed-effects model was chosen in line with heterogeneous \nresults ( I2=0%, p = 0.63). According to the results of a meta-analysis, \ncompared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, CG combined with \ntopical minoxidil therapy significantly reduced the serum IL-12 levels \n(MD = −8.84, 95% CI [−11.20, −6.47], p < 0.00001) ( Figure 7 ).\nSerum IFN-γ levels\nTwo studies [ 16, 21] involving 209 participants reported serum \nIFN-γ levels. A random-effects model was chosen in line with het -\nerogeneous results ( I2=86%, p = 0.007). According to the results of \na meta-analysis, compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, \nCG combined with topical minoxidil therapy significantly reduced \nthe serum IFN-γ levels (MD = −7.44, 95% CI [−11.51, −3.37], \np = 0.0003) ( Figure 8 ).Adverse events\nNine studies [ 16–21 , 23–25 ] reported adverse events. According to \nthe results of our meta-analysis, there was no signifcant difference \nin the incidence of irritant contact dermatitis (RR = 0.51, 95% CI \n[0.25, 1.01], p = 0.05), gastrointestinal reactions (RR = 2.47, 95% CI \n[0.49, 12.55], p = 0.28), lower limb edema (RR = 2.60, 95% CI [0.61, \n11.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CG refers to a group or treatment method involved in clinical studies comparing its efficacy with topical minoxidil therapy in improving various health metrics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOPICAL MINOXIDIL THERAPY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A treatment method used alone in clinical studies for comparison against a combination with CG to assess improvements in health outcomes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CG<|>TOPICAL MINOXIDIL THERAPY<|>CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy was studied and shown to improve clinical efficacy and affect various health metrics compared to topical minoxidil therapy alone<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
