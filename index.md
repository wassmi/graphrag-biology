## Indexing Pipeline

The indexing pipeline is a critical component of GraphRAG-Biology, enabling efficient retrieval and processing of relevant biological information. It consists of the following stages:
**Document Preprocessing**: Removes unnecessary information, tokenizes text, and extracts relevant features from biological research papers.
**Index Building**: Creates an index of the preprocessed documents, capturing key biological entities, relationships, and concepts.
**Index Storage**: Stores the index for fast retrieval, allowing for efficient querying and knowledge retrieval.

Indexing Pipeline Components
**Retriever Index**: Enables fast retrieval of relevant documents based on biological queries.
**Knowledge Graph Index**: Stores relationships between biological entities, facilitating contextual understanding.
**Entity Index**: Maps biological entities to their corresponding knowledge graph nodes.

All the indexing is taken care of by GraphRAG automatically by using the graphrag.index command. 


## Advantages of GraphRAG-Biology

GraphRAG-Biology offers several advantages over traditional RAG frameworks:

1. **Improved Relation Extraction**: GraphRAG-Biology's integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enables better modeling of relational dependencies between biological entities, leading to more accurate relation extraction.

2. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs, GraphRAG-Biology captures contextual relationships and nuances in biological texts, improving overall understanding.

3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: GraphRAG-Biology's modular architecture allows for easy integration with various data sources and formats, making it scalable and adaptable to diverse biological applications.

4. **Handling Private Data**: GraphRAG-Biology's design enables secure handling of private and sensitive biological data, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

5. **Improved Transfer Learning**: GraphRAG-Biology's use of knowledge graphs and GNNs facilitates transfer learning and fine-tuning, enabling effective adaptation to new biological domains and tasks.
