CASE REPORT
Case report: membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis associated with Q fever 
causing chronic endocarditis
Martin Loyen1, Thorsten Wiech2, Stefan Reuter3 and Gerold Thölking1* 
Abstract 
Background Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a rare entity which can be a result from autoimmune 
diseases, caused by various medications and infections.
Case presentation We herein present the case of a 62-year-old male patient who presented with fatigue 
and was found to have severe anemia, impaired renal function, and nephrotic syndrome. A renal biopsy revealed 
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) of the immune complex type with activation of the classical 
complement pathway. Further investigations led to the diagnosis of a chronic Coxiella burnetii-infection (Q fever), 
likely acquired during cycling trips in a region known for intensive sheep farming. Additionally, the patient was found 
to have a post endocarditic destructive bicuspid aortic valve caused by this pathogen. Treatment with hydroxychlo -
roquine and doxycycline was administered for a duration of 24 months. The aortic valve was replaced successfully 
and the patient recovered completely.
Conclusions Early detection and targeted treatment of this life-threatening disease is crucial for complete recovery 
of the patient.

Background
Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is 
a pattern of glomerular injury which can be divided in 
two groups based on the immunofluorescence/immu -
nohistochemical findings [1]. The current classifica -
tion defines a complement-dominant subgroup, called C3 glomerulopathy, and an immunoglobulin dominant 
subgroup, with or without complement, called immune 
complex type. When MPGN is characterized by an 
immunoglobulin-positive pattern, regardless of the pres -
ence of complement, evaluation for chronic infection, 
autoimmune disease, and monoclonal gammopathy 
should be done [2]. The first two of these can lead to anti -
genemia, circulating immune complexes, and immune 
complex deposition in glomeruli [3]. Antigen–antibody 
immune complexes result from chronic infections and 
autoimmune diseases can be associated with elevated 
levels of circulating immune complexes. Glomerular dep -
osition in case of monoclonal gammopathies are caused 
by paraproteinemias.Open Access

Case presentation
A 62-year-old male patient presented to the hospital with 
a six-month history of fatigue and malaise. On examina -
tion, the patient was well-oriented but was ill-looking. 
His vitals included a temperature of 36 °C, heart rate of 
102 beats per minute, blood pressure of 145/96 mm Hg, 
and saturation of 98% in room air. Laboratory investiga -
tions revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin: 6.4 g/dL), nor -
mal C-reactive protein (0.5  mg/dL), and impaired renal 
function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): 
13 mL/min/1.73  m2). Clinically, the patient exhibited fea -
tures of nephrotic syndrome with a urine albumin to cre -
atinine ratio (UACR) of 8.2 g/g creatinine and hematuria. 
The patient reported extensive cycling trips in the north -
western region of Germany, known for intensive sheep 
farming. To further investigate the underlying cause of the nephrotic syndrome, a renal biopsy was performed, 
which confirmed membranoproliferative glomerulone -
phritis (MPGN) of the immune complex type with acti -
vation of the classical complement pathway (Fig.  1). As 
part of the differential diagnostic workup, an echocar -
diogram was performed, revealing a post-endocarditic 
destructive bicuspid aortic valve. In accordance to these 
findings, no fresh vegetations were detected and blood 
cultures remained negative.
Serological testing confirmed a chronic infection with 
Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii) by using an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the follow -
ing results: IgG phase I: 1:8192; IgM phase I: 1:128; IgG 
phase II: 1:16,000; IgM phase II: 1:256. These findings 
were consistent with chronic Q fever, which was likely 
acquired during the patient’s contact with sheep farming.

The complement C3c level was in the normal range of 
0.99  g/L (0.9 – 1.7). There was no evidence of hepatitis 
B, C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Anti -
nuclear antibodies were nonspecifically positive with a 
titre of 1:1280. Double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibod -
ies, extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) and cryoglobulins 
were negative. The patient was started on a treatment 
regimen consisting of hydroxychloroquine (3 × 200  mg/
day) and doxycycline (2 × 100  mg/day) for a duration of 
24 months.
In regards to the bicuspid stenotic aortic valve, the 
patient underwent aortic valve replacement and recov -
ered very well after a rehabilitation period of 8 weeks.
The patient was advised to undergo regular monitoring, 
including therapeutic drug level measurements, ophthal -
mologic examinations, and serological tests at quarterly 
intervals. This was essential to ensure appropriate medi -
cation dosing, monitor for potential ocular side effects, 
and assess treatment response.
The patient exhibited complete clinical recovery and 
showed considerably improved kidney function with an 
eGFR of 43 mL/min/1.73  m2 and a UACR of 90 mg/g two 
years after the initial presentation.
Discussion and conclusions
We herein describe a rare case of an immune-complex-
mediated MPGN resulting from a C. burnetii endocardi -
tis of a bicuspid aortic valve.
C. burnetii is a bacterium causing Q fever, a worldwide 
occurring zoonotic disease. It is an obligate intracellular, 
pleomorphic, Gram-negative bacterium with high infec -
tivity and worldwide distribution. The main reservoir for 
human infection consists of farm animals such as sheep, 
cattle, and goats [4]. Moreover, Celina et  al. postulated 
ticks as a potential risk factor for coxiellosis in livestock 
[5].
Humans get infected through inhalation of C. bur -
netii contaminated aerosols expelled by infected animal 
feces, urine, milk, and birth products [5]. Hence, farm 
and abattoir workers are exposed to an increased risk of 
infection. Although a majority of patients stays misdiag -
nosed or asymptomatic, clinical symptoms can vary from 
fever, respiratory distress, fatigue, arthralgia, hepatitis, 
pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis, pancreatitis, neu -
rological disorder, skin rash, and others [6].
Life-threatening courses have been primarily described 
in chronic Q fever with endocarditis [7]. Since people 
with preexisting valvular heart disease, like the patient 
reported here, have a considerably increased risk of 
endocarditis, serological testing for C. burnetii is recom -
mended when blood cultures are negative [8, 9].
Among patients with valvular defects who suffer from 
Q fever, about 40% develop endocarditis, especially in case of prosthetic valves [10]. But even in native valve 
diseases, the susceptibility for endocarditis seems to be 
higher with bicuspid aortic valves compared to secun -
dum atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and 
pulmonary valve stenosis [11].
Infection-related MPGN patterns can be found in 
various viral and bacterial infections [12, 13]. Bacterial-
related immune-complex MPGN have been described 
in infections including staphylococcus, Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis, streptococci, Propionibacterium acnes, 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, brucella, C. burnetii, nocar -
dia, and meningococcus [1]. In deed only a few cases are 
known which describe MPGN induced by C. burnetii 
endocarditis [14–16].
A constant light microscopy finding in previous case 
reports with Q fever and glomerulonephritis is mesan -
gial expansion and glomerular hypercellularity (either 
mesangial or endocapillary) [15]. Histological changes 
that are typical for MPGN have been rarely described in 
Q fever. In our case light microscopy revealed lobulated 
glomeruli with mesangial proliferation and double con -
tours of the capillary wall as hallmarks of MPGN. Immu -
nohistochemistry showed granular IgG depositions along 
the capillary walls and the mesangium. Corresponding 
electron dense subendothelial deposits were detected 
by electron microscopy. A recently published case by 
Leclerc et al. described a patient with chronic Q fever and 
an MPGN with a full house pattern on immunofluores -
cence with positivity for IgA, IgM, IgG, C3, C1q, kappa 
and lambda as occasionally found in lupus nephritis [15]. 
Interestingly, tests for antinuclear and antiphospholipid 
antibodies showed negative results in their study. In line 
with these data, the antinuclear antibodies in our study 
also showed only nonspecific positivity.
Based on the current understanding of the pathological 
mechanisms, the association between chronic endocardi -
tis caused by C. burnetii and the development of MPGN 
lies in the persistent antibody formation. These anti -
bodies are produced due to chronic inflammation and 
deposit as immune precipitates in the glomerulus. An 
antigen–antibody reaction with glomerular structures 
has not been described in this context so far.
Previous reports on renal disease in chronic Q fever 
described proteinuria values in a range from 0.7–4.0 g/d. 
In our case, urinalysis showed a considerably higher 
UACR of 8.2 g/g creatinine.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of 
a patient with the coincidence of a chronic C. burnetii-
infected native bicuspid aortic valve and a severe MPGN 
with a UACR of 8.2 g/g creatinine.
This case highlights a C. burnetii-infection causing the 
destruction of a bicuspid aortic valve and the induction 
of an immune-complex mediated MPGN. It underscores 
Page 4 of 4 Loyen et al. BMC Nephrology          (2024) 25:291 
the importance of considering rare infectious etiologies 
in patients with blood culture-negative fever, unexplained 
acute kidney injury and a stay in a high-risk environment. 
Early recognition and appropriate treatment are crucial 
for optimizing patient outcomes in such complex cases.
