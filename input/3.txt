Abstract
Background and Objectives
The rs763361 nonsynonymous variant in the CD226 gene, which results in a glycine-to-serine
substitution at position 307 of the CD226 protein, has been implicated as a risk factor of various
immune-mediated diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Compelling evidence suggeststhat this allele may play a signi ﬁcant role in predisposing individuals to MS by decreasing the
immune-regulatory capacity of Treg cells and increasing the proin ﬂammatory potential of
eﬀector CD4 T cells. However, the impact of this CD226 gene variant on CD8 T-cell functions,
a population that also plays a key role in MS, remains to be determined.
Methods
To study whether the CD226 risk variant a ﬀects human CD8 T-cell functions, we used CD8
T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell of 16 age-matched healthy donors ho-
mozygous for either the protective or the risk alle le of CD226. We characterized these CD8 T cells
on T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation using high-parametric ﬂow cytometry and bulk RNAseq and
through characterization of canonical signaling pathways and cytokine production.
Results
On TCR engagement, the phenotype of ex vivo CD8 T cells bearing the protective (CD226-307Gly) or the risk (CD226-307Ser) allele of CD226 was largely overlapping. However, the
transcriptomic signature of CD8 T cells from the donors carrying the risk allele presented an
enrichment in TCR, JAK/STAT, and IFN γsignaling. We next found that the CD226-307Ser
risk allele leads to a selective increase in the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein
kinases extracellular signal –regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) associated with enhanced
phosphorylation of STAT4 and increased production of IFN γ.
Discussion
Our data suggest that the CD226-307Ser risk variant imposes immune dysregulation by in-creasing the pathways related to IFN γsignaling in CD8 T cells, thereby contributing to the risk
of developing chronic in ﬂammation.
Introduction
CD226, also known as DNAM-1 (DNAX accessory molecule-1), is a glycoprotein belonging to
the Ig superfamily that is constitutively expressed on most of NK cells1and T cells.1,2CD226 is

an activating receptor that shares its ligands, CD155 (polio-
virus receptor) and CD112 (nectin-2), with 2 negative reg-
ulators of lymphocyte signaling, CD96 and TIGIT.3CD226 is
involved in the activation and di ﬀerentiation of T cells.1,2,4In
conventional CD4 T cells, CD226 expression is prominent in
Th1 and Th17 cells, whereas it is notably decreased in Th2
cells. Blocking CD226 has been shown to improve the pro-gression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE), an established animal model of multiple sclerosis
(MS).
5,6By contrast, the role of CD226 is more controversial
in CD4 regulatory T-cell functions.7,8In CD8 T cells, CD226
is fundamental for their activation and cytotoxicity, and
CD226-negative CD8 T cells exhibit a reduced antitumorresponse and are dysfunctional when they are activated on T-
cell receptor (TCR) engagement.
9In accordance with its
major role in T-cell functions, CD226 is involved in variouspathologic processes such as autoimmune diseases, cancers,
and viral infectious diseases.
10,11
Several studies have associated the genetic variant of CD226(rs763361T; 307Ser) with increased risk of developing in-
ﬂammatory diseases including MS.
12This disease-associated
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located in the
coding region and generates a glycine-to-serine variation atresidue 307 in the cytoplasmic region of CD226. Pheno-
typically, healthy individuals with the predisposing CD226
genetic variant exhibit decreased surface and gene expressionof CD226 in NK cells, as well as e ﬀector and regulatory CD4
T cells, compared with carriers of the protective variant.
13
Functionally, regulatory T cells from healthy individuals
carrying the protective genetic variant demonstrated en-
hanced suppressive capacity.8We previously showed that
eﬀector CD4 T cells from healthy individuals homozygous
to the risk allele of CD226 produced more IL-17A compared
with those bearing the protective allele.14Furthermore, a
recent study showed that stably transfected human CD4 Twith the risk variant of CD226 exhibited augmented phos-
phorylation of Tyr322 of CD226 and produced higher levels
of IFN γand TNF.
15Moreover, the transfection of mouse
myelin Ag-speci ﬁc CD4 T cells with a mouse/human chi-
meric CD226 harboring the intracellular region (residues
286 –336) of the human risk variant exacerbated EAE path-
ogenicity.15These ﬁndings indicate that the CD226 risk
allele could potentially play a signi ﬁcant role in predisposing
individuals to CNS autoimmunity through mechanisms in-volving the reduction of immune-regulatory capacity in
Tregs and the elevation of proin ﬂammatory potential in ef-
fector CD4 T cells. There is increasing acknowledgment ofthe signi ﬁcant involvement of CD8 T cells in MS. For ex-
ample, histopathologic examinations of postmortem brain
tissue reveal that CD8 T cells outnumber CD4 T cells in MS
lesions.
16,17Moreover, CD8 T-cell lines reactive to myelin
have been demonstrated to induce EAE.18,19Nevertheless,
the eﬀect of the CD226 risk allele on CD8 T-cell functions
remains to be elucidated.
In this study, we combined phenotypic and functional studies
to characterize the impact of the risk allele of CD226 onhuman CD8 T-cell functions. We showed that CD8 T cells
from healthy donors carrying the risk variant of CD226 ex-
hibit an increase in the pathways related to IFN γsignaling.
This is likely contributing to the enhanced in ﬂammation
observed in immune-mediated diseases with which the risk
allele of CD226 has been associated.
Methods
Human PBMCPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthyblood donors were prepared by gradient centrifugation (MLS-
Ficoll, Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) of bu ﬀy coats and kept frozen
in liquid nitrogen. We conducted genotyping for the CD226SNP rs763361 using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay from
Applied Biosystems following the manufacturer ’si n s t r u c t i o n s .
Individuals carrying the rs763361T allele, which results inCD226-307Ser expression, were classi ﬁed as being at risk,
whereas those carrying the rs763361C allele, leading to
CD226-307Gly expression, were considered to have the pro-
tective allele. Experiments were performed on cells from male
donors who were homozygous for either allele.
CD8 T-Cell Isolation and Activation
Frozen PBMCs were thawed and left ON at 37°C, and
monocytes were removed by plastic adherence. CD8 T cellswere puri ﬁed by negative selection using the EasySep Human
CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Stemcell) or sorted by ﬂow
cytometry. The percentage of residual CD4 T cells after de-pletion was always less than 0.5%, and the remaining pop-
ulation consisted of 95 –98% of CD8 T cells. Isolated CD8
T cells were cultured in complete medium RPMI (10% fetalcalf serum, 1% hepes, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% nonessential
amino acids, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1%
L-glutamine) for

the CD8/NK panel LEGENDplex Immunoassay (Biolegend)
following the manufacturer ’s instructions.
Flow Cytometry
Surface staining was performed for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark.
Cells were then ﬁxed and permeabilized using the Fix/Perm kit
(BD) for 30 minutes at RT and were stained for intracellularmarkers for 30 minutes at RT. For cytokine production, the cells
were stimulated for 4 hours with 100 ng/mL of PMA, 1 μg/mL
of ionomycin, and 1 μg/mL of the GolgiPlug monensin (BD
Biosciences). Between each step, cells were washed twice with
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting bu ﬀer containing 2% FCS.
The live/dead marker (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc) was included
in the staining to assess the viability. Proliferation was measured

RNA Sequencing
Fluorescence-activated cell-sorted CD3
+CD8+cells were cul-
tured in complete medium RPMI for 0, 4, and 24 hours in the
presence of 1 μg/mL coated anti-CD3 mAb (clone TR66,

(clone CD28.2, BD). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy
Micro Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer ’si n s t r u c t i o n s .
Libraries were prepared using the Illumina Stranded Total RNA
Prep kit starting from 7.5 ng of total RNA and using 14 PCR
cycles for library ampli ﬁcation. The kit for the index sequences
used was IDT Illumina RNA UDI A Lig 96 Indexes 96 Spl.
Library pool quanti ﬁcation and sequencin g were performed at
the GeT-Sant´ e (I2MC, Toulouse, France) and GeT-PlaGe
(INRAE, Toulouse, France) core facilities, respectively. The
pool was quanti ﬁed by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quanti-
ﬁcation Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) to obtain an accurate
quanti ﬁcation. Subsequently, sequencing was conducted on a
single S4 lane of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illu-
mina, San Diego, USA), using the NovaSeq 6000 S4 v1.5 Re-agent Kit (300 cycles) and a paired-end 2 × 150 pb strategy. Each
library yielded between 20 and 44 million paired-end raw reads.
Simple Western
Primary isolated CD8 cells were expanded on activation withphytohemagglutinin (PHA) in complete medium RPMI for 10
days in the presence of 100U/mL I L-2 (Prepotech). Expanded
CD8 T cells were then stimulated with either 0.5 μg/mL anti-
C D 3( U C H T - 1 ,B D )a n d1 μg/mL anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2,
BD) monoclonal antibodies or LEAF-puri ﬁed mouse IgG1 iso-
type control. Cells were incubated with the speci ﬁed antibodies for
30 minutes on ice, followed by washing with an ice-cold medium
and suspension in a warm medium for 5 minutes at 37°C. Anti-
bodies were cross-linked using the goat anti-mouse Fab2 sec-ondary antibody (20 μg/mL; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for the
indicated time. Stimulation was stopped by adding 2x lysis bu ﬀercontaining 2% Triton X-100 and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein
phosphorylation was assessed by Jess Replex Simple Western with
phosphospeci ﬁc antibodies for ERK1/2 phosphorylated at
Thr202/Tyr204 (D123.14.4E), for serine/threonine protein ki-nase (AKT) phosphorylated at Ser473 (D9E), and for P38
phosphorylated at Thr180/Tyr182 (rabbit polyclonal antibody).
The total amount of proteins was measured using the antibodiesanti-ERK (3A7), anti-AKT (GS K-3B), and anti-P38 (rabbit
polyclonal antibody). All antibodies were from Cell Signaling
Technology. Signals were analyzed using Compass software.
Phosflow STAT
Activated CD8 T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (1 μg/
mL) Abs for 3 days were restimulated in the presence of IL-12
(50 ng/mL, R&D), IFN γ(50 ng/mL, Prepotech), and IFN α
(10,000 U/mL, R&D) for 15 minutes at 37°. The reaction was
stopped by adding the cold ﬁxation bu ﬀer (eBioscience) and
incubating for 50 minutes. Cells were permeabilized using thePhosﬂow Perm Bu ﬀer III (BD) for 15 minutes. The staining
was performed with anti-Stat4 pY693 (clone 38/P, BD) and
anti-Stat1 pY701 (clone 4a, BD). Cells were analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry using Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo
software (version V10, FlowJo, LLC).

Risk Variant of CD226 Does Not Alter the
Phenotype of CD8 T Cells
The speci ﬁc function of a single polymorphism in patients is
challenging because of the in ﬂuence of other risk genes and
therapies. This complexity is highlighted by a study on the
CD226 allele, which showed di ﬀerences between risk and

protective alleles in Tregs from healthy controls while Tregs
from patients with MS behaved like those from healthy con-
trols with the risk allele, suggesting that protective haplotype
eﬀects are nulli ﬁed in the context of ongoing autoimmune
disease.8It is for this reason that we decided to analyze the
impact of the CD226Gly307Ser variant on CD8 T-cell
functions in selected PBMCs from 16 donors homozygous foreither allele. We compared the phenotype of CD8 T cells
carrying the risk (CD226-307Ser) or the protective (CD226-
307Gly) allele ex vivo by ﬂow cytometry. We analyzed the
distribution of the di ﬀerent CD8 T subsets, their expression of
T-cell related markers and transcription factors, and their ex
vivo production of cytokines after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin. We did not ﬁnd any signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences con-
cerning the frequency of na¨ ıve, central memory (CM), ef-
fector memory (EM), or e ﬀector re-expressing CD45RA
(EMRA) CD8 T cells (Figure 1A) between both genotypes.
The frequency of CD226+ cells was comparable across both
genotypes within the 4 CD8 T subsets (Figure 1B). TEMRA,EM, and CM CD8 T cells carrying the risk allele (CD226-
307Ser) expressed a reduced level of CD226 in terms of mean
ﬂuorescent intensity (MFI) when compared with the pro-
tective allele (CD226-307Gly) (Figure 1C), similar to what
was previously reported for CD4 T cells.
4Unsupervised
clustering (eFigure 1, A and B) based on the expression ofT cell –related markers (CD25, CD69, HLA-DR, CD27, TCR,CD28, KLRG1, ICOS, CD57, PD-1, 2B4, CD11b, OX-40,
Ki67, CTLA-4) and transcription factors (FOXP3, EOMES,
T-BET) revealed only 2 clusters being signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent
between the 2 genotypes. Cluster 13 (1.33% of CD8 T cells),characterized by a high expression of CD45RA and CD226
and medium expression of CD27, TIGIT, and EOMES, was
increased in CD8 T cells carrying the CD226-307Ser variant(eFigure 1C). On the contrary, cluster 20 (0.28% of CD8
T cells), characterized by a high expression of CD226, CD27,
and PD1 and medium expression of TIGIT, was decreased inCD8 T cells carrying the CD226-307Ser variant (eFigure 1D).
The di ﬀerential presence of these clusters could represent a
diﬀerent immune regulation in ﬂuenced by the CD226 allele,
but their very low frequency (<1.5%) suggests that the
CD226-307Ser variant has not a major impact on the phe-
notype of CD8 T cells. We, therefore, decided to investigatethe impact of the CD226-307Ser variant on the transcriptome
of the ex vivo CD8 T cells after activation.
Risk Variant of CD226 Alters the
Transcriptional Signature of CD8 T Cells
Signals transmitted by the TCR are regulated by coreceptors,which selectively in ﬂuence distinct signaling pathways and
contribute to the di ﬀerentiation and e ﬀector characteristics
of T cells. It is important to note that it was previouslyshown that CD3/CD28 costimulation activates CD226

independently of CD226 ligation.2,4,20,21In addition, CD8
T cells that do not express CD226 are anergic and do not
respond to the TCR engagement.9Thus, we assessed the
transcriptomic changes associated with the CD226Gly307Servariant using CD8 T cells puri ﬁed from 10 donors homozy-
gous for either allele that were either unstimulated ( “0 hours ”)
or stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs for 4 hoursor 24 hours. We then performed bulk RNA sequencing
(RNAseq) and selected the statistically di ﬀerentially
expressed genes (DEGs, Padj <0.05 and fold change >2)between CD8 T cells carrying the protective or the risk variant
of CD226 at all time points. We did not detect any signi ﬁcant
DEGs in the ex vivo unstimulated T cells and on 4 hours ofactivation. By contrast, we detected 44 upregulated genes in
the risk allele and 96 in the protective allele after 24 hours of
activation (Figure 2A). Of interest, among the di ﬀerentially
overexpressed genes with the risk allele (Figure 2, A and B),
we found IFN γand Granzyme H, 2 key molecules for CD8
T-cell functions. Of note, the nuclear orphan receptor sub-family 4 group A member 3 (NR4A3), triggered by TCR
signaling and related to CD8 T-cell di ﬀerentiation and ef-
fector function,
22was also upregulated with the risk allele.
Other interesting upregulated genes related to T-cell signaling
were oncostatin M (OSM), sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1),
and Fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1). OSMencodes a cytokine and growth regulator that is part of the
cytokine production signaling regulated by ERK and AKT
23
while SPHK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to
form sphingosine 1-phosphate that promotes the activation of
NF-kappa-B and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling.24FLT1 encodes a tyrosine-protein kinase
that is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor family, leading to the activation of phospholipase Cgamma, MAPK, and AKT signaling pathways.
25
To better understand the overall impact of the CD226-Gly307Ser variant on CD8 T-cell transcriptome after 24 hours
of stimulation, we performed gene ontology (Figure 2C) and
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichmentanalyses (Figure 2D). Results revealed increased expression of
genes involved in regulation of protein kinase activity, JAK-
STAT and PI3K-AKT signaling, calcium signaling pathway,cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and cellular senescence.
To explore whether certain signaling pathways began to be
deregulated after 4 hours of stimulation, we performed the geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) that uses a di ﬀerent and
complementary methodology to di ﬀerential expression analysis
(eFigure 2). Of note, it con ﬁrmed the enrichment of genes
involved in T-cell receptor (eFigure 2A) and JAK-STAT sig-
naling pathways (eFigure 2B) already detected at 24 hours.
Moreover, we also found an enrichment of genes involved in“positive regulation of IFN γproduction ”in the CD8 T cells
from donors carrying the risk allele compared with those car-
rying the protective allele (eFigure 2C). These results suggestthat on CD3 and CD28 stimulation, CD8 T cells carrying the
risk allele are transcriptionally more prone to support TCR
signaling, JAK-STAT pathways, and IFN γproduction.Risk Allele of CD226 Selectively Increases the
Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in CD8 T CellsIn murine thymocytes, the deletion of CD226 a ﬀects the
TCR-induced activation of AKT, ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1),
NF-KB, and P38 (MAPK14) signaling
26suggesting that
CD226 ﬁne-tunes TCR signaling. Thus, we compared the
TCR signaling of expanded human CD8 T cells carrying the
CD226 protective or risk variant after the engagement ofthe TCR. We showed that the CD226 risk allele led to a
selective increase in the phosphorylation of the MAPKs
extracellular signal –regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)
after TCR stimulation of CD8 T cells (Figure 3, A and B). In
comparison, the CD226 risk allele did not a ﬀect signi ﬁ-
cantly the extent of AKT (Figure 3, A and C) and MAPKp38 (Figure 3, A and D) phosphorylation indicative of its
speciﬁceﬀect on TCR signaling pathways. Because ERK is
one of the main signaling molecules involved in di ﬀerent
T-cell programs, such as act ivation, proliferation, di ﬀeren-
tiation, and cytokine production, we next sought to in-
vestigate whether the impact of the Gly307Ser variant ofCD226 on ERK activation could be associated with changes
in CD8 T-cell functions.
CD226 Risk Allele Confers Elevated IFN γ
Production by CD8 T Cells
To analyze the impact of the CD226 Gly307Ser variant on
CD8 T-cell functions, we isolated CD8 T cells and stimulatedthem for 3 days with plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb alone or in
combination with anti-CD28 mAb. The cells were then ana-
lyzed for proliferation, viability, activation markers, andtranscription factor expression by ﬂow cytometry. In addition,
the cytokine production in culture supernatants collected af-
ter 3 days of stimulation was determined by CBA.
We did not ﬁnd any signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences in CD8 T-cell
viability and proliferation between the 2 genotypes(eFigure 3A). The frequency of CD226-positive CD8 T cells
increased on activation with a higher trend in the CD8
T cells from the risk group while the MFI was similarlyaugmented (eFigure 3B). CD8 T cells from both groups
expressed similar frequencies and MFI of the activation
markers CD69 and PD1 indicative of comparable activationlevels (eFigure 3, C and D). In addition, the expression of
the receptor TIGIT was not di ﬀerent between the 2 groups
(eFigure 3E). Among all cytokines tested, only IFN γwas
signiﬁcantly increased in the supernatant of CD8 T cells
expressing the risk allele (Figure 4A). By contrast, the pro-
duction of TNF, IL-17, IL-10, perforin, GranzB, GranzA,and FasL was not statistically di ﬀerent between the 2 ge-
notypes (eFigure 4). To investigate whether the increased
levels of IFN γin the supernatants were the consequence of
an increased secretion at the cell level or an increased fre-
quency of IFN γproducing CD8 T cells, we analyzed the
IFNγexpression by ﬂow cytometry using intracytoplasmic
staining. Although there was only a tendency for an in-
creased proportion of cells producing IFN γ(Figure 4B), the
IFNγMFI was increased in CD8 T cells expressing the
Neurology.org/NN Neurology: Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation | Volume 11, Number 6 | November 2024
e200306(5)
CD226-307Ser variant (Figure 4C), suggesting that in-
dividual CD8 T cells carrying the risk allele had a higherability to produce IFN γon activation with anti-CD3 and
anti-CD28 mAbs. This result is in line with the positive
regulation of the IFN γproduction pathway found in our
RNAseq analysis and con ﬁrms the increased capacity of
IFNγsecretion by CD8 T cells harboring the risk variant
after TCR activation.Risk Allele of CD226 Promotes IL-12R β2/STAT4/
IFNγPathways in CD8 T Cells
The signaling pathways that contribute to IFN γproduction
have been well characterized. IFN γreceptor (IFNGR) sig-
naling activates the signal transducer and activator of tran-
scription 1 (STAT1), which in turn induces the expression of
T-BET in e ﬀector T cells.
27This leads to the expression of the
β2 chain of IL-12 receptor (IL-12R β2) that induces theFigure 2 Transcriptomics of CD8 T Cells Carrying the Protective or the Risk Variant of CD226

phosphorylation of STAT4 and ampli ﬁes the production of
IFNγ.28To study the mechanisms by which the CD226
Gly307Ser polymorphism modulates IFN γproduction by
CD8 T cells, we measured by ﬂow cytometry the expression of
IFNγR1 and IL-12R and the phosphorylation of STAT1 and
STAT4 in CD8 T cells on activation. We ﬁrst analyzed
whether the e ﬀects of CD226 variants on IFN γsecretion were
associated with a di ﬀerential IFN γR-mediated signaling. We
showed that the expression of IFN γR and the transcription
factor T-BET was similar between activated CD8 T cells ofboth genotypes (eFigure 5, A and B). The phosphorylation of
STAT1 after the activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs
(eFigure 5C) and on further incubation for 15 minutes withIFNγ(eFigure 5D) or IFN α(eFigure 5E) was also compa-
rable between both genotypes, suggesting that the CD226
variant operates independently of IFN γR-mediated signaling.
The cell surface abundance of the β1 (eFigure 5F) and β2
chains (eFigure 5 G) of the IL-12R was comparable in CD8
T cells carrying the risk or the protective allele of CD226,indicating that the di ﬀerence in IFN γsecretion was not theFigure 3 TCR Signaling of CD8 T Cells Carrying the Protective or the Risk Variant of CD226

consequence of an alteration of IL-12 receptor expression. By
contrast, on TCR engagement, the proportion of pSTAT4-
positive cells was higher in CD8 T cells carrying the CD226
risk allele compared with CD8 T cells with the protective one(Figure 5A). Restimulating the cells for 15 minutes in the
presence of IL-12 further increased the phosphorylation of
STAT4 (Figure 5B). We obtained a similar result on stimu-lation in the presence of IFN αfor 15 minutes, suggesting that
this observation is not speci ﬁc to IL-12, rather related to
STAT4 itself (Figure 5C).
We next tested whether these alterations of the IFN γpathway
were still observed on CD8 T-cell activation under Tc1 po-larization conditions. Thus, we activated total CD8 T cells
with anti-CD3 mAb and IL-12 for 3 or 5 days. The expression
of CD69 was similar between the 2 groups indicating com-parable activation (Figure 6A, eFigure 6A). Compared with
stimulation with CD3 alone, the addition of IL-12 signi ﬁ-
cantly increased the frequency of CD226+ (Figure 6B) and T-BET+ (Figure 6C) only in the CD8 T cells carrying the risk
allele. The level of expression of CD226 (eFigure 6B) and
T-BET (eFigure 6C) was similar between both genotypes.Secretion of IFN γwas drastically increased on IL-12 sup-
plementation, and this was again higher in the supernatant of
CD8 T cells expressing the risk allele (Figure 6D). After ad-dition of IL-12, we found that the IL-12R β2 chain, known to
be regulated by STAT4, was upregulated with a strong dif-
ference between the 2 CD226 alleles especially after 5 days ofactivation (Figure 7A, eFigure 6D). By contrast, in this ex-
perimental setting, the IL-12R β1 was slightly sensitive to IL-
12 (Figure 7B, eFigure 6E). Of interest, after IL-12 addition,
all cells that expressed the IL-12R β2 on the addition of IL-12
were CD226+ (Figure 7C), suggesting that CD226 is directly
involved in the IL-12R β2/STAT4/IFN γpathway and that
this pathway is ampli ﬁed in donors expressing the CD226 risk
variant (Figure 7D).
Discussion
Mounting appropriate T cell –driven immune responses re-
quires the integration of a multitude of signals that arise from
various types of receptors. The TCR signaling pathways in-
duced after antigen stimulation are ﬁne-tuned by cos-
timulatory molecules to adjust the sensitivity of T cells to
antigen stimulation in given immunologic contexts. Conse-
quently, the polymorphisms in gene coding for these cos-timulatory molecules can a ﬀect their expression and function,
leading to the dysregulation of the immune response. This
highlights the importance of performing functional studiesusing the genetic variants of these costimulatory molecules to
understand the mechanisms by which they in ﬂuence the im-
mune response.
In this study, we investigated the impact of the CD226
Gly307Ser polymorphism on CD8 T cells at the phenotypic,

transcriptomic, and functional levels. Ex vivo CD8 T cells
from donors carrying the risk variant do not exhibit tangible
phenotypical di ﬀerences compared with cells from donors
expressing the protective variant, except for a decreased ex-
pression of CD226 in the ex vivo e ﬀector/memory CD8
T cells. This observation is in line with what has been alreadyreported in NK, e ﬀector, and regulatory CD4 T cells.

CD8 T-cell activation is mainly triggered by TCR recognition
of MHC-I-peptide complexes, and costimulatory/inhibitorymolecules play a fundamental role in ﬁne-tuning CD8 T-cell
activation. Indeed, it has been shown that CD8 T cells that do
not express CD226 are less responsive to TCR stimulation,
9
and a recent study showed that deletion of CD226 in murinethymocytes impaired TCR activation signaling and di-minished AKT, ERK, NF- κB, and p38 phosphorylation lev-
els,
26suggesting that CD226 contributes to these TCR
signaling pathways. Converging evidence suggests thatCD226 may synergize with TCR signaling in a CD122/
CD155-independent manner.
2,4,21These ligand-independent
mechanisms are not unusual because several transmembranereceptors including chemokine receptors
30,31and cos-
timulatory molecules32,33were shown to be transactivated on
TCR ligation and to increase T-lymphocyte activation in-dependently of their ligands. For example, TCR ligation was
shown to induce transactivation of CXCR4 in the absence of
its ligand CXCL12 resulting in the formation of TCR-CXCR4complex that increases IL2mRNA stability and subsequent
T-cell proliferation.
30,31In line with these studies, we detected
in CD8 T cells expressing the risk allele of CD226 an in-creased expression of transcripts regulating TCR signaling on
activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs. We tested the
phosphorylation of some canonical signaling molecules andshowed that the CD226 risk allele leads to a selective increasein the phosphorylation of ERK after TCR stimulation of CD8
T cells. In comparison, the CD226 risk allele did not a ﬀect the
extent of phosphorylation of the MAPK p38, indicative of thespeciﬁceﬀect of the CD226 genetic variant on TCR signaling
pathways. Because ERK2 selectively enhances the production
of Th1 cytokines without a ﬀecting T-BET abundance,
34we
speculated that the CD226 risk allele might favor IFN γpro-
duction by CD8 T cells through ERK activation. Of interest,
related to ERK pathways, in the RNA sequencing data, we alsofound an enrichment in IFN γand STAT gene signature. In
accordance, we detected an increased phosphorylation of
STAT4 by ﬂow cytometry and the increased production of
IFNγin the supernatants of stimulated CD8 T cells
expressing the risk variant. Together, these data show that theCD226-307Ser risk variant ampli ﬁes the IFN γpathways in
CD8 T cells.
IFNγis one of the major cytokines produced by CD8 T cells in
the context of infection, tumor control, and autoimmunity. The
main signaling pathways that induce IFN γproduction by
T cells are mediated by cytokine activation of the JAK-STAT
family. In particular, IFN γitself, IFN α, and IL-12 have been
shown to be implicated in this mechanism. IFN γbinds to the
heterodimeric IFN γR that leads to the downstream tyrosine
phosphorylation of STAT1 to induce expression of IFN γ-
regulated genes and T-BET. IL-12 binds to IL-12R inducingSTAT4 phosphorylation leading to its dimerization and
translocation to the nucleus, where it binds the DNA and
ampliﬁes the expression of IFN γ.I F N αbinds to IFNAR,
resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and
STAT4 complexes. In our model, both IL-12 and IFN αinduce
the increased phosphorylation of STAT4 in the risk allelecompared with the protective allele, suggesting an importantFigure 6 Functionality of CD8 T Cells Carrying the Protective or the Risk Variant of CD226 in Th1-Polarized Condition

role of CD226 in the STAT4 pathway independent of the
cytokine used to stimulate it. The addition of IL-12 on acti-vation with anti-CD3 mAb led to an ampli ﬁcation of IFN γ
production and IL-12R β2 expression in CD8 T cells expressing
the CD226 risk allele, suggesting an ampli ﬁcation in the loop
STAT4-IL12R β2-IFN γ. Of interest, IL-12R and STAT4 are
also known as genetic risk variants for MS, suggesting a co-
ordinated involvement of this pathway in MS pathogenesis.
35
Besides MS,12the genetic variant of CD226 (rs763361T;
307Ser) is also associated with an increased risk of type 1
diabetes,36rheumatoid arthritis,37neuromyelitis optica,38
primary immune thrombocytopenia,39juvenile idiopathic
arthritis,40Wegener granulomatosis,41and autoimmune thy-
roid disease.42Of note, as for MS, there is also strong evidence
that CD8 T cells play a prominent role in some of thesehuman diseases associated with the risk variant of CD226
such as type 1 diabetes and
43rheumatoid arthritis.44Our
study shows that CD8 T cells from donors carrying theCD226 risk variant produce high levels of IFN γand thismechanism could be part of the immune dysregulation that
contributes to the pathogenesis of these immune-mediateddiseases. Thus, these ﬁndings provide important novel in-
formation about the potential mechanisms by which rs763361
aﬀects CD226 signaling and CD8 T-cell functions.
