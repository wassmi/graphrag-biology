ABSTRACT
Introduction:  Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune skin disease. Our study aimed to 
systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of compound glycyrrhizin (CG) combined with topical 
minoxidil therapy in treating AA.
Methods:  We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and 
VIP databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy 
compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone for AA were included. The Cochrane Collaborative 
Network Tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Statistical analysis was completed using RevMan5.3 
software and Stata 15.0 software. The GRADE system was used to evaluate the quality of evidence for 
outcomes.
Result:  11 RCTs and 1189 patients were included. Compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, CG 
combined with topical minoxidil therapy was more effective at improving the clinical efficacy (RR = 
1.36, 95% CI [1.27, 1.45], p < 0.00001). The SALT score (MD = −10.09, 95% CI [−12.89, −7.30], p < 0.00001), 
serum TNF-α levels (MD = −0.99, 95% CI [−1.19, −0.39], p < 0.00001), serum IL-12 levels (MD = −8.84, 
95% CI [−11.20, −6.47], p < 0.00001) and serum IFN-γ levels (MD = −7.44, 95% CI [−11.51, −3.37], 
p = 0.0003) were reduced, and the serum TGF-β1 levels (MD = 2.40, 95% CI [1.24, 3.57], p < 0.0001) were 
increased. There were no significant differences in reported adverse events, including irritant contact 
dermatitis (RR = 0.51, 95% CI [0.25, 1.01], p = 0.05), ’ gastrointestinal reactions (RR = 2.47, 95% CI [0.49, 
12.55], p = 0.28), lower limb edema (RR = 2.60, 95% CI [0.61, 11.06], p = 0.20), facial edema (RR = 2.33, 
95% CI [0.61, 8.93], p = 0.22), or localized itching (RR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.18, 1.75], p = 0.32), between the 
two groups.
Conclusion:  The current evidence indicates that CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy is effective 
and safe for AA. However, owing to the suboptimal quality of the included studies, more high-quality 
and large-scale RCTs are needed for comprehensive analysis and further validation.
Introduction
Alopecia areata (AA) is a common chronic tissue-specific autoim -
mune disease that is characterized by patchy hair loss on the scalp 
[1]. AA affects up to 2% of the general population, irrespective of 
age, race, or sex [ 2]. It is often considered a cosmetic problem, but 
it can cause an enormous psychological burden on patients, seri -
ously affecting their daily life and self-esteem [ 3]. Topical therapy 
is used as a first-line therapy for alopecia, and topical minoxidil 
has beed the only FDA-approved over-the-counter drug uesd to 
treat androgenetic alopecia for over 30 years [ 4]. It has been used 
to treat many other types of alopecia, including AA, since its 
approval. It can slow hair loss by prolonging the growth period 
and promote hair regeneration by increasing hair diameter and density. Notably, the efficacy of topical minoxidil as a monother -
apy is unsatisfactory. Multiple studies have shown that combina -
tion therapy can achieve better clinical efficacy [ 5]. Therefore, we 
aimed to collect the relevant published literature, evaluate the 
efficacy of combination therapy on AA, and provide a new alter -
native therapy for AA.
The compound glycyrrhizin (CG) has anti-inflammatory, 
anti-allergic and immunomodulatory effects, and can exert 
glucocorticoid-like effects safely [ 6]. CG enhances the activity of 
lymphocytes by promoting the activation of NK cells and T cells, 
thereby inhibiting the progression of AA, inhibiting phospholipase 
activity, and exerting antimicrobial effects to promote new hair 
growth [ 7]. In recent years, clinical research on the combination of 
CG and topical minoxidil for treating AA has gradually increased,

but the relative effectiveness and safety of this combination ther -
apy have not been systematically analyzed. This study conducted 
a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis based on relevant RCTs, 
aiming to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of CG 
combined with topical minoxidil therapy for AA and provide a 
optimized treatment option for AA.
Methods
This study complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Review and Meta-analyses Statement (PRISMA) [ 8]. We 
registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024528846).
Search strategy
A systematic literature search was conducted in 7 databases from 
their inception to March 28, 2024: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane 
Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure 
(CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP databases. The following terms were 
used for the search: alopecia areata, alopecia, compound glycyr -
rhizin, glycyrrhizin, minoxidil. The search strategy was slightly 
modified due to corresponding database. The details can be found 
in Supplementary Table 1 . In addition, we also searched the list of 
references included in the studies to further identify eligible papers.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs). (2) The recognized diagnostic 
criteria had to be reported in the included studies, with no restric -
tions on the clinical types of AA, age, race, and gender of patients. 
(3) The experimental intervention applied CG combined with topi -
cal minoxidil therapy. The control group received the same topical 
minoxidil as the experimental group. (4) The main outcome mea -
sures were Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score [ 9, 10] and clini -
cal efficacy. The clinical efficacy with specific definitions at home 
and abroad were all accepted [ 11, 12], which can divide into clin -
ical cure, marked efficacy, effective and no efficacy. Clinical cure is 
defined by all new hair grows out, densely distributed, with hair 
thickness and color similar to normal hair. Marked efficacy is 
defined by new hair grows by 50% to 99%, with a significant 
amount of velvety hair turning into coarse hair. We define the 
number of patients with clinical efficacy = number of "clinically 
cured" patients + number of "marked efficacy" patients. Secondary 
outcomes were serum TNF-α, TGF-β1, IL-12, IFN-γ levels and 
adverse reactions.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Studies about AA but 
mixed with other illnesses. (2) Non-RCTs, such as reviews, case 
reports and conference abstracts. (3) Unable to obtain full-text or 
data or duplicate published research.
Data extraction
Two researchers (Gu XR and Li JC) extracted the following data 
separately for all studies meeting the inclusion criteria inde -
pendently: study characteristics (including first author, country and 
year of publication), baseline data (including age, gender, sample 
size and disease course), intervention measures (dose and fre -
quency of CG, usage of minoxidil) and outcome data. All the 
extracted data were cross-checked. Any disagreements arising during this process were discussed and addressed with the third 
researcher (Guo CQ).
Assessment of risk of bias
Two researchers (Wang YD and Yang GJ) used the quality evalua -
tion criteria provided in the Cochrane Intervention System 
Evaluation Manual to evaluate the basic risk of the included liter -
ature [ 13]. Seven evaluation items were evaluated: random 
sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of investi -
gators and/or subjects, blinding of study results evaluators, integ -
rity of results data, selective reporting, and other bias. Each items 
was classified as having a low, unclear or high risk of bias. Any 
agreement was resolved by the third researcher (Guo CQ).
GRADE evaluation
The GRADE system is used to evaluate the quality of evidence for 
outcomes [ 14]. The degradation factors mainly include five aspects: 
risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other con -
siderations. The quality definition is classified as extremely low 
quality evidence (+), low quality evidence (++), medium quality 
evidence (+++), and high quality evidence (++++).
Statistical analysis
RevMan 5.3 software was used for data analysis. The dichotomous 
outcomes were expressed as risk ratio (RR), the continuous out -
comes were analyzed using the mean difference (MD), and each 
effect size was expressed as a 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Heterogeneity was evaluated using the χ2 test and I2 test. When 
p > 0.1 and I2 < 50%, a fixed-effects model was selected for the 
meta-analysis. Otherwise, a fixed-effects model should be adopted. 
Subgroup analyses were used based on study design if possible. In 
addition, STATA 15.0 was used for sensitivity analysis to explore 
potential sources of heterogeneity. A funnel plot for evaluating 
publication bias was employed if the number of included studies 
was ≥ 10.
Result
Literature retrieval
A total of 196 studies were retrieved from the 7 electronic data -
bases, and 101 duplicates were removed. Then, after reading the 
titles and abstracts of the remaining 95 studies, we further 
excluded an additional 67 irrelevant studies. Next, after reading 
the full text of the remaining 28 studies, 17 studies were further 
excluded. Finally, 11 studies were included in this work [ 15–25 ]. 
(Figure 1 )
Characteristics of the included studies
11 RCTs included in this work were published between 2009 and 
2021, all of which were conducted in China. A total of 1189 par -
ticipants were involved ( n = 603 and n = 586 from the experimental 
group and control groups, separately). In each study, the dosage 
of CG was 3 times daily applications with 50–75 mg per applica -
tion. For the concentration of minoxidil, 9 studies used 5% and the JOURNAL  OF DERMATOLOGICAL  TREATMENT 3
remained 2 studies were 2%. The treatment course is 2 or 3 months. 
The characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1 .
Risk of bias
Three studies [ 15, 17, 19] reported the use of random number 
tables, one study [ 21] reported the order of entering the hospital, 
and the other studies did not report their detailed randomization 
generation approach. None of the included studies reported allo -
cation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel or 
blinding of outcome assessments. Other potential biases men -
tioned in included studies were unclear due to limited informa -
tion. The results of the bias risk evaluation are presented in 
Figure 2 .
Clinical efficacy
Eleven studies [ 15–25 ] involving 1189 patients reported clinical 
efficacy. A fixed-effects model was chosen in line with heteroge -
neous results ( I2=0%, p = 0.99). According to the results of a 
meta-analysis, the combination of CG and topical minoxidil ther -
apy could improve clinical efficacy compared with that of topical 
minoxidil therapy alone (RR = 1.36, 95% CI [1.27, 1.45], p < 0.00001). 
A subgroup analysis was performed for the treatment course. The clinical efficacy in the CG with a course of 2 months plus topical 
minoxidil group was better than that in the topical minoxidil alone 
group (RR = 1.46, 95% CI [1.21, 1.76], p < 0.0001). The similar result 
can be observed at a course of 3 months (RR = 1.34, 95% CI [1.25, 
1.43], p < 0.00001) ( Figure 3 ).
SAL T score
Five studies [ 15, 17, 19, 21, 22] involving 585 participants reported 
SALT scores. A random-effects model was chosen in line with het -
erogeneous results ( I2=97%, p < 0.0001). According to the results of 
a meta-analysis, compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, 
CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy significantly reduced 
the SALT score (MD = −10.09, 95% CI [−12.89, −7.30], p < 0.00001) 
(Figure 4 ).
Serum TNF-α levels
Two studies [ 15, 19] involving 230 participants reported serum TNF-α 
levels. A fixed-effects model was chosen in line with heterogeneous 
results ( I2=0%, p = 0.70). According to the results of a meta-analysis, 
compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, CG combined with 
topical minoxidil therapy significantly reduced the serum TNF-α levels 
(MD = −0.99, 95% CI [−1.19, −0.39], p < 0.00001) ( Figure 5 ).
Figure 1.  Study selection process.4 C. GUO ET AL.
Serum TGF-β1 levels
Three studies [ 15, 16, 19] involving 319 participants reported 
serum TGF-β1 levels. A fixed-effects model was chosen in line with 
heterogeneous results ( I2=0%, p = 0.88). According to the results of 
a meta-analysis, compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, 
CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy significantly increased 
the serum TGF-β1 levels (MD = 2.40, 95% CI [1.24, 3.57], p < 0.0001) 
(Figure 6 ).
Serum IL-12 levels
Two studies [ 15, 19] involving 230 participants reported serum IL-12 
levels. A fixed-effects model was chosen in line with heterogeneous 
results ( I2=0%, p = 0.63). According to the results of a meta-analysis, 
compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, CG combined with 
topical minoxidil therapy significantly reduced the serum IL-12 levels 
(MD = −8.84, 95% CI [−11.20, −6.47], p < 0.00001) ( Figure 7 ).
Serum IFN-γ levels
Two studies [ 16, 21] involving 209 participants reported serum 
IFN-γ levels. A random-effects model was chosen in line with het -
erogeneous results ( I2=86%, p = 0.007). According to the results of 
a meta-analysis, compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, 
CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy significantly reduced 
the serum IFN-γ levels (MD = −7.44, 95% CI [−11.51, −3.37], 
p = 0.0003) ( Figure 8 ).Adverse events
Nine studies [ 16–21 , 23–25 ] reported adverse events. According to 
the results of our meta-analysis, there was no signifcant difference 
in the incidence of irritant contact dermatitis (RR = 0.51, 95% CI 
[0.25, 1.01], p = 0.05), gastrointestinal reactions (RR = 2.47, 95% CI 
[0.49, 12.55], p = 0.28), lower limb edema (RR = 2.60, 95% CI [0.61, 
11.06], p = 0.20), facial edema (RR = 2.33, 95% CI [0.61, 8.93], 
p = 0.22), and localized itching (RR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.18, 1.75], 
p = 0.32) between the two groups. Other adverse reactions included 
dizziness [ 16] and mild increase in blood pressure [ 23]. All of these 
adverse reactions in the two groups can be resolved sponta -
neously and did not affect subsequent treatment ( Figure 9 ).
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses were performed using the method of 
omitting individual studies one by one to evaluate the influence 
on pooled results due to the heterogeneity of the meta-analyses 
on the clinical efficacy, SALT score, serum TNF-α, TGF-β1, IL-12 and 
IFN-γ levels. The analyses indicated there were no significant influ -
ences on any outcome, suggesting that the sensitivity was low 
and the results were robust ( Figure 10 ).
Assessment of publication bias
The funnel plot analysis of clinical effective rate showed asymme -
try, which indicated potential publication bias ( Figure 11 ).Table 1.  included studies characteristics.

Level of evidence
The evidence of clinical efficacy, serum TNF-α, TGF-β1 and IL-12 levels 
were identified as “moderate-quality” , meanwhile, the equality of evi -
dence for SALT score and serum IFN-γ levels were identified as 
“low-quality” . In conclusion, all of them were moderate or weak rec -
ommendations. The details can be found in Supplementary Table 2 .
Discussion
AA is characterized by systemic dysregulation of Th1 (TNF-α, IL-12 
and IFN-γ), Th2, and Th17 (TGF-β1) cytokines [ 26]. Studies have 
shown that patients with AA with a SALT score of ≥ 25% have 
higher serum TNF-α levels than those with a SALT score of < 25%, 
and the serum TNF-α levels are positively correlated with the 
severity of AA [ 27, 28]. Compared with healthy control individuals, 
patients with AA have greater expression of IL-12 mRNA in peripheral blood monocytes, and serum IL-12 levels are positively 
correlated with the severity and duration of hair loss [ 29, 30]. 
IFN-γ- induced immune collapse of hair follicles can cause the 
occurrence of AA [ 31]. A study showed an increased serum levels 
of IFN-γ in patients with active AA in comparison with patients 
with stable AA [ 32]. TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that can reg -
ulate the growth cycle of hair follicles and the degradation period 
of hair growth and also activate hair follicle stem cells to stimulate 
hair growth [ 33]. The serum levels of TGF-β1 in patients with AA 
are lower than those in healthy people, especially in patients with 
active AA [ 27, 34].
CG is derived from the traditional Chinese medicine licorice, and as 
a complementary and alternative TCM treatment method, it has been 
widely used to treat various skin diseases closely related to autoim -
mune reactions [ 35]. CG can inhibit the activity of CD4+ cells, CD8+ 
cells and related cytokines and enhance the differentiation of extrathy -
mic T cells. Thus, it inhibits the progression of AA and promotes hair 
regeneration [ 36]. Our study found that adding CG to topical minoxidil 
can reduce the levels of multiple Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-12 and 
IFN-γ). Meanwhile, several studies have shown that CG can increase 
the levels of IL-10 in patients with AA [ 16, 37]. And IL-10 is mainly 
produced by Th2 cells, which can inhibit the production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit the immune response of Th1 
type cells. These indicated that CG may treat AA by regulating the bal -
ance of Th1/Th2 cells.
Topical minoxidil can promote the proliferation and differentiation 
of hair follicle epithelial cells, improve the microvascular circulation 
around hair follicles, and activate potassium channels on peripheral 
arterial smooth muscles, inducing cell proliferation. Moreover, it can 
also increase vascular endothelial growth factor in dermal cells in a 
dose-dependent manner, stimulate the production of prostaglandin 
E2, and thus prolong the anagen phase [ 38]. The combination of oral 
CG and topical minoxidil is suggested to compensate for the short -
comings of topical application in overall immune regulation, 
anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects, balances helper T-cell func -
tion, suppresses autoimmune reactions, reduces local inflammatory 
reactions in AA, and improves clinical efficacy.
Many research have shown that the evaluation of trichoscopic 
can help diagnose AA and predict the course of the disease. For 
example, black dots, broken hairs, and exclamation mark hairs may 
be related to the activity of AA, while yellow dots may be posi -
tively correlated with the severity of AA. Short vellus hairs are 
adversely correlated with the severity or activity of the AA [ 39, 40]. 
Notably, one study we included reported the trichoscopic findings, 
which revealed that after 12 weeks and 6 months of combined 
treatment with CG and topical minoxidil, the number of black 
dots, broken hairs, exclamation mark hairs, and empty follicular 
openings in AA area significantly decreased, while the number of 
short vellus hairs increased [ 16]. Also, it indicated that this combi -
nation therapy can improve hair and hair follicle density, as well as 
reduced recurrence rates.
In this study, we analyzed 11 RCTs and systematically evaluated 
the efficacy and safety of CG combined with topical minoxidil for 
the treatment of AA. The results suggested that CG combined with 
topical minoxidil therapy increased clinical efficacy relative to that 
of topical minoxidil therapy alone. Moreover, it decreased the SALT 
score and serum TNF-α, IL-12 and IFN-γ levels and increased the 
serum TGF-β1 levels. In terms of safety, there was no significant 
difference in adverse reactions, including irritant contact dermati -
tis, gastrointestinal reactions, lower limb edema, facial edema or 
localized itching, between the two groups. These findings indicate 
that combination therapy does not increase the occurrence of 
adverse reactions.

Limitations
The studies analyzed were limited by: First, several factors 
seemed to have an impact on the degree of treatment response, 
including patient characteristics and demographics, disease 
characteristics (such as age of onset, severity, disease course, AA subtype, etc) and prior treatments. Due to the limited infor -
mation included we reviewed, we were unable to analyze all 
the above-mentioned factors. Second, the samples sizes of the 
studies were small. All included studies were conducted in 
China, and all participants were Chinese, which may cause 
potential regional or racial differences. Third, only 2–3 studies 8 C. GUO ET AL.
reported outcome indicators for the serum TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-γ 
and TGF-β1, reducing the quality of evidence of the results. 
Fourth, according to the GRADE evaluation system, the quality 
of evidence in outcome indicators was moderate or low. 
Consequently, more high-quality studies are needed to verify 
the effectiveness of CG combined with topical minoxidil ther -
apy for AA treatment.
Conclusion
CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy may be safe and 
effective but due to the poor quality of evidence provided in the 
studies we reviewed, more robust studies are needed before this 
treatment can be recommended.Ethical statement
