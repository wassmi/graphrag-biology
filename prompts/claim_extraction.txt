-Target activity-
You are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.

-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.

-Steps-
1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can include:
   - Genes, proteins, and other biomolecules
   - Organisms and cell types
   - Biological processes and pathways
   - Experimental techniques and methods
   - Diseases and phenotypes
2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims in biological research may include:
   - Gene function or regulation
   - Protein-protein interactions
   - Pathway involvement
   - Disease associations
   - Experimental results and observations
For each claim, extract the following information:
- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.
- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.
- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type
- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.
- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.
- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.
- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.

Format each claim as (<subject_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<object_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_type>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_status>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_start_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_end_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_description>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_source>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Examples-
Example 1:
Entity specification: gene, protein
Claim description: function or interaction of biological entities
Text: A recent study published on 2023/05/15 found that the BRCA1 gene plays a crucial role in DNA repair. The BRCA1 protein was shown to interact with PARP1, enhancing its activity in response to DNA damage.
Output:

Example 2:
Entity specification: gene, protein, disease
Claim description: gene-disease association and protein function
Text: A study published on 2023/06/20 in Nature Genetics revealed that mutations in the ATM gene are strongly associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The ATM protein, which functions as a DNA damage sensor, was found to have reduced activity in pancreatic cancer cells. This impaired DNA repair mechanism may contribute to the development and progression of the disease.
Output:
