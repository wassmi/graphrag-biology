-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, using standard biological nomenclature
- entity_type: One of the following types: [GENE, PROTEIN, ORGANISM, CELL_TYPE, BIOLOGICAL_PROCESS, PATHWAY, DISEASE, EXPERIMENTAL_METHOD]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's biological attributes and functions
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a biological context.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation of the biological relationship between the source entity and the target entity
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the biological relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
 
3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
 
4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Example 1:
Entity_types: GENE,PROTEIN,BIOLOGICAL_PROCESS
Text:
The p53 tumor suppressor gene plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. When activated, the p53 protein binds to specific DNA sequences and promotes the transcription of various target genes involved in these processes. One such target is the BAX gene, which encodes a pro-apoptotic protein that contributes to mitochondrial-mediated cell death.

Example 2:
Entity_types: ORGANISM,CELL_TYPE,BIOLOGICAL_PROCESS
Text:
The study published in 2023/05/15 found that the Bacillus subtilis bacterium exhibits a unique ability to form biofilms on various surfaces. This biofilm formation is mediated by the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the expression of specific genes involved in the process. The biofilm formation is associated with increased resistance to antibiotics and persistence in hostile environments.

Text:
The study published in 2023/05/15 found that the BRCA1 gene plays a crucial role in DNA repair. The BRCA1 protein was shown to interact with PARP1, enhancing its activity in response to DNA damage. This interaction is associated with increased survival rates in patients with breast cancer, particularly those with BRCA1 mutations.
